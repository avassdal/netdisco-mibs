           Protocol to uniquely identify a bridge.  Its first two

           used to refer to a bridge in a unique fashion
           (typically, the numerically smallest MAC address
           of all ports on the bridge).
           Several objects in this MIB module represent values of
           timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.  In this
           MIB, these timers have values in units of hundreths of
           a second (i.e. 1/100 secs).
           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however,
           that 802.1D-1998 specifies a settable granularity of
           no more than 1 second for these timers.  To avoid
           ambiguity, a data type is defined here as a textual
           convention and all representation of these timers
           in this MIB module are defined using this data type.  An
           algorithm is also defined for converting between the
           different units, to ensure a timer's value is not                                  distorted by multiple conversions."

Timeout ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
     DISPLAY-HINT "d"
     STATUS       current
     DESCRIPTION
          "A Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) timer in units of 1/100
           seconds.  Several objects in this MIB module represent
           values of timers used by the Spanning Tree Protocol.
           In this MIB, these timers have values in units of
           hundredths of a second (i.e., 1/100 secs).

           These timers, when stored in a Spanning Tree Protocol's
           BPDU, are in units of 1/256 seconds.  Note, however, that
           802.1D-1998 specifies a settable granularity of no more
           than one second for these timers.  To avoid ambiguity,
           a conversion algorithm is defined below for converting
           between the different units, which ensures a timer's
           value is not distorted by multiple conversions.

           To convert a Timeout value into a value in units of
           1/256 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

               b = floor( (n * 256) / 100)

           where:
               floor   =  quotient [ignore remainder]
               n is the value in 1/100 second units
               b is the value in 1/256 second units

           To convert the value from 1/256 second units back to
           1/100 seconds, the following algorithm should be used:

               n = ceiling( (b * 100) / 256)

           where:
               ceiling = quotient [if remainder is 0], or
                         quotient + 1 [if remainder is nonzero]
               n is the value in 1/100 second units

               b is the value in 1/256 second units

           Note: it is important that the arithmetic operations are
           done in the order specified (i.e., multiply first,
           divide second)."

   DESCRIPTION 
      "The type of the port is by default hybrid port. 
       When configured as access port, the port can accept and send 
       only untagged frames.
       When configured as a trunk port, port is added as 
       member of all the existing Vlans and also for any new vlan
       created. 
       When configured as hybrid port, the port can send or accept both 
       tagged and untagged frames.  
       
       hostPort, promiscuousPort are types of port in PVLAN domain.
       Behaviour of host port varies based on the secondary vlan to which
       it is configured as member port.

       If a host port is a member port of an isolated VLAN, traffic from the 
       host port is sent only to the promiscuous port of the Private VLAN and 
       the trunk port.

       If a host port is a member port of the community VLAN, traffic from the 
       port can be sent only to other ports of the community VLAN , trunk port 
       and promiscuous port of the private VLAN.

       A host port can be associated with only one secondary vlan and with
       the associated primary vlan.

       The PVID of host port will be set the ID of the secondary vlan
       to which it belongs to.
       If a host port is member port of primary vlan, but is not member port 
       of any secondary vlan, then its PVID will be set to primary vlan id.

       Promiscuous ports should be configured as member port of primary vlan 
       and member port of all(some) secondary vlans associated with that 
       primary vlan.

       The PVID of promiscuous port will be set as the ID of the primary 
       vlan to which it belongs to.

       Host and  promiscuous ports should be configured as untagged members
       of primary/secondary vlans.

       When a access/hybrid port is configured as a member port of a
       primary/secondary vlan, it becomes a hostPort automatically."

          Note:BIT 0 - Least significant bit

          For example,setting the cipher list to the value - 001 0101,

                 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
