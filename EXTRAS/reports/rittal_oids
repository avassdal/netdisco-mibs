.1.3.6.1.2.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::system,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4,SNMPv2-MIB::sysContact,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The textual identification of the contact person for this managed node, together with information on how to contact this person. If no contact information is known, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,SNMPv2-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,current,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11,IF-MIB::ifInUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17,IF-MIB::ifOutUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.18,IF-MIB::ifOutNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.21,IF-MIB::ifOutQLen,Gauge32,read-only,,deprecated,,The length of the output packet queue (in packets).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IPv4 routers forward datagrams. IPv4 hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). When this object is written, the entity should save the change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,IP-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IPv4 header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol. When this object is written, the entity should save the change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3,IP-MIB::ipInReceives,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of input datagrams received from interfaces, including those received in error. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInRecieves.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.4,IP-MIB::ipInHdrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IPv4 headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IPv4 options, etc. This object has been deprecated as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInHdrErrors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,IP-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IPv4 address in their IPv4 header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IPv4 routers, and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInAddrErrors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,IP-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IPv4 destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IPv4 routers, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source-Route option processing was successful. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInForwDatagrams.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,IP-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteDest,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The destination IP address of this route. An entry with a value of 0.0.0.0 is considered a default route. Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric1,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The primary routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric2,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric3,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteNextHop,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The IP address of the next hop of this route. (In the case of a route bound to an interface which is realized via a broadcast media, the value of this field is the agent's IP address on that interface.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteType,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,other(1):invalid(2):direct(3):indirect(4),The type of route. Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipRouteType object.

Inclusion of values for gateway routing protocols is not intended to imply that hosts should support those protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteAge,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The number of seconds since this route was last updated or otherwise determined to be correct.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.11,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMask,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,Indicate the mask to be logical-ANDed with the destination address before being compared to the value in the ipRouteDest field. For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0. It should be noted that all IP routing subsystems implicitly use this mechanism.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric5,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

If this information is not present, its value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }, which is a syntatically valid object identifier, and any conformant implementation of ASN.1 and BER must be able to generate and recognize this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The IPv4 Address Translation table used for mapping from IPv4 addresses to physical addresses. This table has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by the ipNetToPhysicalTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaEntry,,not-accessible,ipNetToMediaIfIndex:ipNetToMediaNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one IpAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaIfIndex,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex. This object predates the rule limiting index objects to a max access value of 'not-accessible' and so continues to use a value of 'read-create'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaPhysAddress,OCTET,read-create,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. This object should return 0 when this entry is in the 'incomplete' state. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.3,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaNetAddress,IpAddress,read-create,,deprecated,,The IpAddress corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address. This object predates the rule limiting index objects to a max access value of 'not-accessible' and so continues to use a value of 'read-create'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.4,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaType,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dis-associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation- specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,IP-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries. This object was defined in pre-IPv6 versions of the IP MIB. It was implicitly IPv4 only, but the original specifications did not indicate this protocol restriction. In order to clarify the specifications, this object has been deprecated and a similar, but more thoroughly clarified, object has been added to the IP-FORWARD-MIB.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table allows the user to determine the source of an IP address or set of IP addresses, and allows other tables to share the information via pointer rather than by copying. For example, when the node configures both a unicast and anycast address for a prefix, the ipAddressPrefix objects for those addresses will point to a single row in this table. This table primarily provides support for IPv6 prefixes, and several of the objects are less meaningful for IPv4. The table continues to allow IPv4 addresses to allow future flexibility. In order to promote a common configuration, this document includes suggestions for default values for IPv4 prefixes. Each of these values may be overridden if an object is meaningful to the node. All prefixes used by this entity should be included in this table independent of how the entity learned the prefix. (This table isn't limited to prefixes learned from router advertisements.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixEntry,,not-accessible,ipAddressPrefixIfIndex:ipAddressPrefixType:ipAddressPrefixPrefix:ipAddressPrefixLength,current,,An entry in the ipAddressPrefixTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface on which this prefix is configured. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.3,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixPrefix,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The address prefix. The address type of this object is specified in ipAddressPrefixType. The length of this object is the standard length for objects of that type (4 or 16 bytes). Any bits after ipAddressPrefixLength must be zero. Implementors need to be aware that, if the size of ipAddressPrefixPrefix exceeds 114 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.4,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixLength,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The prefix length associated with this prefix. The value 0 has no special meaning for this object. It simply refers to address '::/0'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.5,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixOrigin,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):manual(2):wellknown(3):dhcp(4):routeradv(5),The origin of this prefix.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.6,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixOnLinkFlag,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has the value 'true(1)', if this prefix can be used for on-link determination; otherwise, the value is 'false(2)'. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 'true(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.7,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAutonomousFlag,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),Autonomous address configuration flag. When true(1), indicates that this prefix can be used for autonomous address configuration (i.e., can be used to form a local interface address). If false(2), it is not used to auto- configure a local interface address. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 'false(2)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.8,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAdvPreferredLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be preferred, i.e., time until deprecation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from a deprecated prefix should no longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets received on such an interface are processed as expected. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 4,294,967,295 (infinity).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.9,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAdvValidLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be valid, i.e., time until invalidation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from an invalidated prefix should not appear as the destination or source address of a packet. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 4,294,967,295 (infinity).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.33,IP-MIB::ipAddressSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP managers to coordinate their use of the set operation in creating or modifying rows within this table. In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipAddressTableSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command, including the retrieved value of ipAddressSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipAddressSpinLock will have changed, and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipAddressSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipAddressSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34,IP-MIB::ipAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains addressing information relevant to the entity's interfaces. This table does not contain multicast address information. Tables for such information should be contained in multicast specific MIBs, such as RFC 3019. While this table is writable, the user will note that several objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not. The intention in allowing a user to write to this table is to allow them to add or remove any entry that isn't permanent. The user should be allowed to modify objects and entries when that would not cause inconsistencies within the table. Allowing write access to objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, could allow a user to insert an entry and then label it incorrectly. Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this table, the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in order to differentiate between the possible interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressEntry,,not-accessible,ipAddressAddrType:ipAddressAddr,current,,An address mapping for a particular interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressAddrType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of ipAddressAddr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.2,IP-MIB::ipAddressAddr,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP address to which this entry's addressing information pertains. The address type of this object is specified in ipAddressAddrType. Implementors need to be aware that if the size of ipAddressAddr exceeds 116 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.3,IP-MIB::ipAddressIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.4,IP-MIB::ipAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,unicast(1):anycast(2):broadcast(3),The type of address. broadcast(3) is not a valid value for IPv6 addresses (RFC 3513).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.5,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefix,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,A pointer to the row in the prefix table to which this address belongs. May be { 0 0 } if there is no such row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.6,IP-MIB::ipAddressOrigin,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):manual(2):dhcp(4):linklayer(5):random(6),The origin of the address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.7,IP-MIB::ipAddressStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,preferred(1):deprecated(2):invalid(3):inaccessible(4):unknown(5):tentative(6):duplicate(7):optimistic(8),The status of the address, describing if the address can be used for communication. In the absence of other information, an IPv4 address is always preferred(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.8,IP-MIB::ipAddressCreated,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was created. If this entry was created prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.9,IP-MIB::ipAddressLastChanged,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last updated. If this entry was updated prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.10,IP-MIB::ipAddressRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. The RowStatus TC requires that this DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances other objects in this row can be modified. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. A conceptual row can not be made active until the ipAddressIfIndex has been set to a valid index.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.11,IP-MIB::ipAddressStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row. If this object has a value of 'permanent', then no other objects are required to be able to be modified.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The IP Address Translation table used for mapping from IP addresses to physical addresses. The Address Translation tables contain the IP address to 'physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries. While many protocols may be used to populate this table, ARP and Neighbor Discovery are the most likely options.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,ipNetToPhysicalIfIndex:ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType:ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress,current,,Each entry contains one IP address to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.2,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The type of ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.3,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP Address corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address. The address type of this object is specified in ipNetToPhysicalAddressType. Implementors need to be aware that if the size of ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress exceeds 115 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.4,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The media-dependent `physical' address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.5,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalLastUpdated,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last updated. If this entry was updated prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.6,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4):local(5),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToPhysicalTable. That is, it effectively dis- associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType object. The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol. The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been statically configured. Both of these refer to entries that provide mappings for other entities addresses. The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided for an entity's own interface address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.7,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalState,INTEGER,read-only,,current,reachable(1):stale(2):delay(3):probe(4):invalid(5):unknown(6):incomplete(7),The Neighbor Unreachability Detection state for the interface when the address mapping in this entry is used. If Neighbor Unreachability Detection is not in use (e.g. for IPv4), this object is always unknown(6).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.8,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. The RowStatus TC requires that this DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances other objects in this row can be modified. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. A conceptual row can not be made active until the ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress object has been set. Note that if the ipNetToPhysicalType is set to 'invalid', the managed node may delete the entry independent of the state of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.36,IP-MIB::ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table used to describe IPv6 unicast and multicast scope zones. For those objects that have names rather than numbers, the names were chosen to coincide with the names used in the IPv6 address architecture document.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.36.1.1,IP-MIB::ipv6ScopeZoneIndexIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which these scopes belong. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.2,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP address of the default router represented by this row. The address type of this object is specified in ipDefaultRouterAddressType. Implementers need to be aware that if the size of ipDefaultRouterAddress exceeds 115 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.3,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface by which the router can be reached. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.4,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this router will continue to be useful as a default router. A value of zero indicates that it is no longer useful as a default router. It is left to the implementer of the MIB as to whether a router with a lifetime of zero is removed from the list. For IPv6, this value should be extracted from the router advertisement messages.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.5,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterPreference,INTEGER,read-only,,current,reserved(-2):low(-1):medium(0):high(1),An indication of preference given to this router as a default router as described in he Default Router Preferences document. Treating the value as a 2 bit signed integer allows for simple arithmetic comparisons. For IPv4 routers or IPv6 routers that are not using the updated router advertisement format, this object is set to medium (0).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.38,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP managers to coordinate their use of the set operation in creating or modifying rows within this table. In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command including the retrieved value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock will have changed and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.39,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information used to construct router advertisements.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.6.19.1.2,TCP-MIB::tcpConnectionLocalAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The local IP address for this TCP connection. The type of this address is determined by the value of tcpConnectionLocalAddressType. As this object is used in the index for the tcpConnectionTable, implementors should be careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs with more than 128 subidentifiers; otherwise the information cannot be accessed by using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.6.19.1.3,TCP-MIB::tcpConnectionLocalPort,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The local port number for this TCP connection.

The value listen(2) is included only for parallelism to the old tcpConnTable and should not be used. A connection in LISTEN state should be present in the tcpListenerTable. The only value that may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then the TCB (as defined in [RFC793]) of the corresponding connection on the managed node is deleted, resulting in immediate termination of the connection. As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note, however, that RST segments are not sent reliably).

An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType of unknown (0) and a tcpListenerLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length octet-string). 2. An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or IPv6 datagrams is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type and a tcpListenerLocalAddress of '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively. 3. An application that is listening for data destined only to a specific IP address, but from any remote system, is represented by a tcpListenerLocalAddressType of an appropriate address type, with tcpListenerLocalAddress as the specific local address. NOTE: The address type in this table represents the address type used for the communication, irrespective of the higher-layer abstraction. For example, an application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use InetAddressType ipv4(1)).

The value of this object can be represented in three possible ways, depending on the characteristics of the listening application: 1. For an application willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object must be ''h (a zero-length octet-string), with the value of the corresponding tcpListenerLocalAddressType object being unknown (0). 2. For an application willing to accept only IPv4 or IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object must be '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively, with tcpListenerLocalAddressType representing the appropriate address type. 3. For an application which is listening for data destined only to a specific IP address, the value of this object is the specific local address, with tcpListenerLocalAddressType representing the appropriate address type. As this object is used in the index for the tcpListenerTable, implementors should be careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs with more than 128 subidentifiers; otherwise the information cannot be accessed, using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.6.20.1.4,TCP-MIB::tcpListenerProcess,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The system's process ID for the process associated with this listener, or zero if there is no such process. This value is expected to be the same as HOST-RESOURCES-MIB:: hrSWRunIndex or SYSAPPL-MIB::sysApplElmtRunIndex for some row in the appropriate tables.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.4,RFC1213-MIB::udpOutDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of UDP datagrams sent from this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.5,RFC1213-MIB::udpTable,,not-accessible,,mandatory,,A table containing UDP listener information.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.5.1,RFC1213-MIB::udpEntry,,not-accessible,udpLocalAddress:udpLocalPort,mandatory,,Information about a particular current UDP listener.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.5.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::udpLocalAddress,IpAddress,read-only,,mandatory,,The local IP address for this UDP listener. In the case of a UDP listener which is willing to accept datagrams for any IP interface associated with the node, the value 0.0.0.0 is used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.5.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::udpLocalPort,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The local port number for this UDP listener.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table containing information about this entity's UDP endpoints on which a local application is currently accepting or sending datagrams. The address type in this table represents the address type used for the communication, irrespective of the higher-layer abstraction. For example, an application using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use InetAddressType ipv4(1). Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows the representation of an application that completely specifies both local and remote addresses and ports. A listening application is represented in three possible ways: 1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length octet-string). 2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively. 3) An application that is listening for datagrams only for a specific IP address but from any remote system is represented by a udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress specifying the local address. In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0. If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets by remote address and port, or if the application has 'connected' the socket specifying a default remote address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should be used to reflect this.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointEntry,,not-accessible,udpEndpointLocalAddressType:udpEndpointLocalAddress:udpEndpointLocalPort:udpEndpointRemoteAddressType:udpEndpointRemoteAddress:udpEndpointRemotePort:udpEndpointInstance,current,,Information about a particular current UDP endpoint. Implementers need to be aware that if the total number of elements (octets or sub-identifiers) in udpEndpointLocalAddress and udpEndpointRemoteAddress exceeds 111, then OIDs of column instances in this table will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.1,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointLocalAddressType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of udpEndpointLocalAddress. Only IPv4, IPv4z, IPv6, and IPv6z addresses are expected, or unknown(0) if datagrams for all local IP addresses are accepted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.2,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointLocalAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The local IP address for this UDP endpoint. The value of this object can be represented in three possible ways, depending on the characteristics of the listening application: 1. For an application that is willing to accept both IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object must be ''h (a zero-length octet-string), with the value of the corresponding instance of the udpEndpointLocalAddressType object being unknown(0). 2. For an application that is willing to accept only IPv4 or only IPv6 datagrams, the value of this object must be '0.0.0.0' or '::', respectively, while the corresponding instance of the udpEndpointLocalAddressType object represents the appropriate address type. 3. For an application that is listening for data destined only to a specific IP address, the value of this object is the specific IP address for which this node is receiving packets, with the corresponding instance of the udpEndpointLocalAddressType object representing the appropriate address type. As this object is used in the index for the udpEndpointTable, implementors of this table should be careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs with more than 128 subidentifiers; else the information cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.3,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointLocalPort,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The local port number for this UDP endpoint.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.4,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointRemoteAddressType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of udpEndpointRemoteAddress. Only IPv4, IPv4z, IPv6, and IPv6z addresses are expected, or unknown(0) if datagrams for all remote IP addresses are accepted. Also, note that some combinations of udpEndpointLocalAdressType and udpEndpointRemoteAddressType are not supported. In particular, if the value of this object is not unknown(0), it is expected to always refer to the same IP version as udpEndpointLocalAddressType.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.5,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointRemoteAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The remote IP address for this UDP endpoint. If datagrams from any remote system are to be accepted, this value is ''h (a zero-length octet-string). Otherwise, it has the type described by udpEndpointRemoteAddressType and is the address of the remote system from which datagrams are to be accepted (or to which all datagrams will be sent). As this object is used in the index for the udpEndpointTable, implementors of this table should be careful not to create entries that would result in OIDs with more than 128 subidentifiers; else the information cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.6,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointRemotePort,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The remote port number for this UDP endpoint. If datagrams from any remote system are to be accepted, this value is zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.7,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointInstance,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The instance of this tuple. This object is used to distinguish among multiple processes 'connected' to the same UDP endpoint. For example, on a system implementing the BSD sockets interface, this would be used to support the SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT socket options.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.7.1.8,UDP-MIB::udpEndpointProcess,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The system's process ID for the process associated with this endpoint, or zero if there is no such process. This value is expected to be the same as HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSWRunIndex or SYSAPPL-MIB:: sysApplElmtRunIndex for some row in the appropriate tables.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.8,UDP-MIB::udpHCInDatagrams,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of UDP datagrams delivered to UDP users, for devices that can receive more than 1 million UDP datagrams per second. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.7.9,UDP-MIB::udpHCOutDatagrams,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of UDP datagrams sent from this entity, for devices that can transmit more than 1 million UDP datagrams per second. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.8.5.1.14,RFC1213-MIB::egpNeighMode,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,active(1):passive(2),The polling mode of this EGP entity, either passive or active.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.8.5.1.15,RFC1213-MIB::egpNeighEventTrigger,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,start(1):stop(2),A control variable used to trigger operator- initiated Start and Stop events. When read, this variable always returns the most recent value that egpNeighEventTrigger was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the node, it returns a value of `stop'. When set, this variable causes a Start or Stop event on the specified neighbor, as specified on pages 8-10 of RFC 904. Briefly, a Start event causes an Idle peer to begin neighbor acquisition and a non-Idle peer to reinitiate neighbor acquisition. A stop event causes a non-Idle peer to return to the Idle state until a Start event occurs, either via egpNeighEventTrigger or otherwise.

Also, implementations which authenticate community-based SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching the community name (for example, by also checking whether the message originated from a transport address allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include in this value the number of messages which failed the additional check(s). It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any security model which is used to authenticate community-based SNMP messages specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.11.5,SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInBadCommunityUses,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of community-based SNMP messages (for example, SNMPv1) delivered to the SNMP entity which represented an SNMP operation that was not allowed for the SNMP community named in the message. The precise conditions under which this counter is incremented (if at all) depend on how the SNMP entity implements its access control mechanism and how its applications interact with that access control mechanism. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any access control mechanism which is used to control access to and visibility of MIB instrumentation specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.11.6,SNMPv2-MIB::snmpInASNParseErrs,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of ASN.1 or BER errors encountered by the SNMP entity when decoding received SNMP messages.

The value of this object overrides any configuration information; as such, it provides a means whereby all authenticationFailure traps may be disabled. Note that it is strongly recommended that this object be stored in non-volatile memory so that it remains constant across re-initializations of the network management system.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.11.32,SNMPv2-MIB::snmpProxyDrops,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of Confirmed Class PDUs (such as GetRequest-PDUs, GetNextRequest-PDUs, GetBulkRequest-PDUs, SetRequest-PDUs, and InformRequest-PDUs) delivered to the SNMP entity which were silently dropped because the transmission of the (possibly translated) message to a proxy target failed in a manner (other than a time-out) such that no Response Class PDU (such as a Response-PDU) could be returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16,RMON-MIB::rmon,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.0,RMON-MIB::rmonEventsV2,,,,,,Definition point for RMON notifications.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1,RMON-MIB::statistics,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet statistics entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsEntry,,not-accessible,etherStatsIndex,current,,A collection of statistics kept for a particular Ethernet interface. As an example, an instance of the etherStatsPkts object might be named etherStatsPkts.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies this etherStats entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that had a length (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).

Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card.

When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::historyControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this historyControl entry. Each instance of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry will be deleted by the agent if this historyControlEntry is not equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,etherHistoryIndex:etherHistorySampleIndex,current,,An historical sample of Ethernet statistics on a particular Ethernet interface. This sample is associated with the historyControlEntry which set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. As an example, an instance of the etherHistoryPkts object might be named etherHistoryPkts.2.89
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The history of which this entry is a part. The history identified by a particular value of this index is the same history as identified by the same value of historyControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets (including bad packets) received during this sampling interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.3.1.4,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingMLHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold.

The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.

This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hostControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. During this time, all associated hostTopNEntries shall remain inaccessible. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the hostTopNTable. Thus, the hostTopN table needs to be created only at the end of the collection interval.

When the associated hostTopNTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the hostTopNTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this hostTopNControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostTopNRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of hosts requested for the top N table.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.6.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::matrixControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.6.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::matrixControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7,RMON-MIB::filter,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1,RMON-MIB::filterTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of packet filter entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterEntry,,not-accessible,filterIndex,current,,A set of parameters for a packet filter applied on a particular interface. As an example, an instance of the filterPktData object might be named filterPktData.12
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the filter table. Each such entry defines one filter that is to be applied to every packet received on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::filterChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the channel of which this filter is a part. The filters identified by a particular value of this object are associated with the same channel as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset from the beginning of each packet where a match of packet data will be attempted. This offset is measured from the point in the physical layer packet after the framing bits, if any. For example, in an Ethernet frame, this point is at the beginning of the destination MAC address. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::filterOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::filterStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this filter entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2,RMON-MIB::channelTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of packet channel entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1,RMON-MIB::channelEntry,,not-accessible,channelIndex,current,,A set of parameters for a packet channel applied on a particular interface. As an example, an instance of the channelMatches object might be named channelMatches.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::channelIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the channel table. Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::channelIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the interface on this remote network monitoring device to which the associated filters are applied to allow data into this channel. The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1,RMON2-MIB::channel2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::channelDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4,RMON2-MIB::filter2Table,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1,RMON2-MIB::filter2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirDataLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with performs the following operations on every packet: 1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by this object, discard the packet and exit (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified protocol). 2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by that object, discard the packet and exit. 3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the filterOffset value to move further into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with will discard the packet if the packet doesn't match this protocol directory entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8,RMON-MIB::capture,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of buffers control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,current,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters. As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCapturedPackets,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets currently in this captureBuffer.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTurnOnTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this capture buffer was first turned on.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::bufferControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::bufferControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this buffer Control Entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of packets captured off of a channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1,RMON-MIB::captureBufferEntry,,not-accessible,captureBufferControlIndex:captureBufferIndex,current,,A packet captured off of an attached network. As an example, an instance of the captureBufferPacketData object might be named captureBufferPacketData.3.1783
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::captureBufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The index of the bufferControlEntry with which this packet is associated.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the captureBuffer table associated with a particular bufferControlEntry. This index will start at 1 and increase by one for each new packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex. Should this value reach 2147483647, the next packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex shall cause this value to wrap around to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketTime,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of milliseconds that had passed since this capture buffer was first turned on when this packet was captured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStats2Table,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1. This table has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStats2Entry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1.1,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStatsDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1.2,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStatsCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,deprecated,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11,RMON2-MIB::protocolDir,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.10,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this protocol directory entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this protocolDistControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this row. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13,RMON2-MIB::addressMap,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this entry in the addressMapControlTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for this addressMapControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this addressMap control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last created or the values of the physical address changed. This can be used to help detect duplicate address problems, in which case this object will be updated frequently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14,RMON2-MIB::nlHost,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated nlHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been deleted from the nlHost table (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alHostTable is not implemented or is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.

The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirHostConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirHostConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all addresses seen as the source or destination address in all packets with no MAC errors, and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors.

The hlHostControlIndex value in the index identifies the hlHostControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the nlHostAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is nlHostOutPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) matrix control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level matrix tables containing conversation statistics indexed by pairs of network addresses. Both the network- and application-level matrix tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer matrix records in memory, it can derive network-layer matrix records from them.) Entries in the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alMatrix tables, entries in the alMatrix tables will be created on behalf of each entry in this table.

If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The addition of a conversation into both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two insertions (even though every addition into one table must be accompanied by an insertion into the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time.

Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there.

If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReversePktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSPkts object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDOctets object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReverseOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSOctets object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDOctets object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNOctetRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18,RMON2-MIB::usrHistory,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a group of user-defined MIB objects to be sampled periodically (called a bucket-group). For example, an instance of usrHistoryControlInterval might be named usrHistoryControlInterval.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlObjects,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of MIB objects to be collected in the portion of usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. This object may not be modified if the associated instance of usrHistoryControlStatus is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.7,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this variable history control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the usrHistoryTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A list of MIB instances to be sampled periodically. Entries in this table are created when an associated usrHistoryControlObjects object is created. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index is that of the associated usrHistoryControlEntry. For example, an instance of usrHistoryObjectVariable might be usrHistoryObjectVariable.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19,RMON2-MIB::probeConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.1,RMON2-MIB::probeCapabilities,BITS,read-only,,current,etherStats(0):historyControl(1):etherHistory(2):alarm(3):hosts(4):hostTopN(5):matrix(6):filter(7):capture(8):event(9):tokenRingMLStats(10):tokenRingPStats(11):tokenRingMLHistory(12):tokenRingPHistory(13):ringStation(14):ringStationOrder(15):ringStationConfig(16):sourceRouting(17):protocolDirectory(18):protocolDistribution(19):addressMapping(20):nlHost(21):nlMatrix(22):alHost(23):alMatrix(24):usrHistory(25):probeConfig(26),An indication of the RMON MIB groups supported on at least one interface by this probe.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to '0.0.0.0' when no IP address has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.8,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadAction,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notDownloading(1):downloadToPROM(2):downloadToRAM(3),When this object is set to downloadToRAM(3) or downloadToPROM(2), the device will discontinue its normal operation and begin download of the image specified by probeDownloadFile from the server specified by probeDownloadTFTPServer using the TFTP protocol. If downloadToRAM(3) is specified, the new image is copied to RAM only (the old image remains unaltered in the flash EPROM). If downloadToPROM(2) is specified, the new image is written to the flash EPROM memory after its checksum has been verified to be correct. When the download process is completed, the device will warm boot to restart the newly loaded application. When the device is not downloading, this object will have a value of notDownloading(1). This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.

This object will have a value of downloadStatusUnknown(2) if no download process has been performed. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.10,RMON2-MIB::serialConfigTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,A table of serial interface configuration entries. This data will be stored in non-volatile memory and preserved across probe resets or power loss.

If either the netConfigIPAddress or netConfigSubnetMask is 0.0.0.0, then when the device boots, it may use BOOTP to try to figure out what these values should be. If BOOTP fails before the device can talk on the network, this value must be configured (e.g., through a terminal attached to the device). If BOOTP is used, care should be taken to not send BOOTP broadcasts too frequently and to eventually send them very infrequently if no replies are received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.11.1.2,RMON2-MIB::netConfigSubnetMask,IpAddress,read-create,,deprecated,,The subnet mask of this Net interface. The default value for this object is 0.0.0.0.

This entry is associated with any eventEntries in the RMON MIB whose value of eventCommunity is equal to the value of this object. Every time an associated event entry sends a trap due to an event, that trap will be sent to each address in the trapDestTable with a trapDestCommunity equal to eventCommunity, as long as no access control mechanism precludes it (e.g., VACM). This object may not be modified if the associated trapDestStatus object is equal to active(1).

An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each logical area of storage that is allocated and has fixed resource limits. The amount of storage represented in an entity is the amount actually usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to formatting or file system reference information. These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system. Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table. Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space'). This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures. In addition, it can be a useful performance monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer usage.

This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it. If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:ifRcvAddressAddress,current,,A list of objects identifying an address for which the system will accept packets/frames on the particular interface identified by the index value ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.1,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,An address for which the system will accept packets/frames on this entry's interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.2,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This object is used to create and delete rows in the ifRcvAddressTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTableLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable. If the number of entries has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.6,IF-MIB::ifStackLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last change of the (whole) interface stack. A change of the interface stack is defined to be any creation, deletion, or change in value of any instance of ifStackStatus. If the interface stack has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entityPhysical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per physical entity. There is always at least one row for an 'overall' physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical entity. Each entry provides objects (entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalVendorType, and entPhysicalClass) to help an NMS identify and characterize the entry and objects (entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalParentRelPos) to help an NMS relate the particular entry to other entries in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of physical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalVendorType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to an enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device. If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entPhysicalChildIndex,current,,A single container/'containee' relationship.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.

The Interface Identifier is combined with an address prefix to form an interface address. By default, the Interface Identifier is autoconfigured according to the rules of the link type this interface is attached to. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceIdentifier.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.7,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfIdentifierLength,INTEGER,read-write,,obsolete,,The length of the Interface Identifier in bits. This object is obsolete. It can be derived from the length of IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceIdentifier; Interface Identifiers that are not an even number of octets are not supported.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.8,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,obsolete,,The interface's physical address. For example, for an IPv6 interface attached to an 802.x link, this object normally contains a MAC address. Note that in some cases this address may differ from the address of the interface's protocol sub-layer. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length. This object is obsoleted by IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.9,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,obsolete,up(1):down(2),The desired state of the interface. When a managed system initializes, all IPv6 interfaces start with ipv6IfAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ipv6IfAdminStatus is then changed to the up(1) state (or remains in the down(2) state). This object is obsolete. IPv6 does not have a separate admin status; the admin status of the interface is represented by IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.

The noIfIdentifier(3) state indicates that no valid Interface Identifier is assigned to the interface. This state usually indicates that the link-local interface address failed Duplicate Address Detection. If ipv6IfAdminStatus is down(2) then ipv6IfOperStatus should be down(2). If ipv6IfAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ipv6IfOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should remain in the down(2) or noIfIdentifier(3) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(5) state if the interface has missing (typically, lower layer) components. This object is obsolete. IPv6 does not have a separate operational status; the operational status of the interface is represented by IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.

This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., ::0) and unsupported addresses (e.g., addresses with unallocated prefixes). For entities which are not IPv6 routers and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipIfStatsInAddrErrors.

Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IPv6 fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received. This counter is incremented at the interface to which these fragments were addressed which might not be necessarily the input interface for some of the fragments. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipIfStatsReasmFails.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.1.1,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one or more rows per physical network connection known to this agent. The agent may wish to ensure that only one ptopoConnEntry is present for each local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple ptopoConnEntries for the same local port. Entries based on lower numbered identifier types are preferred over higher numbered identifier types, i.e., lower values of the ptopoConnRemoteChassisType and ptopoConnRemotePortType objects.

A particular ptopoConnIndex value may be reused in the event an entry is aged out and later re-learned with the same (or different) remote chassis and port identifiers. An agent is encouraged to assign monotonically increasing index values to new entries, starting with one, after each reboot. It is considered unlikely that the ptopoConnIndex will wrap between reboots.

In such a case, an NMS application should ignore any returned value for this object. This object may not be modified if the associated ptopoConnRowStatus object has a value of active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.1.1.1.11,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnAgentNetAddr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object identifies a network address which may be used to reach an SNMP agent entity containing information for the chassis and port components represented by the associated 'ptopoConnRemoteChassis' and 'ptopoConnRemotePort' objects. If no such address is known, then this object shall contain an empty string. This object may not be modified if the associated ptopoConnRowStatus object has a value of active(1).

If this entry has an associated ptopoConnRemoteChassisType and/or ptopoConnRemotePortType value other than 'portIdMacAddr(3)', then the value 'notUsed(1)' is returned. Otherwise, one of the following conditions must be true: If the agent has not yet detected any unicast source MAC addresses from the remote port, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned. If the agent has detected exactly one unicast source MAC address from the remote port, then the value 'oneAddr(3)' is returned. If the agent has detected more than one unicast source MAC address from the remote port, then the value 'multiAddr(4)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.1.1.1.13,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnMultiNetSASeen,INTEGER,read-only,,current,notUsed(1):unknown(2):oneAddr(3):multiAddr(4),This object indicates if multiple network layer source addresses have been detected by the agent from the remote connection endpoint, since the creation of this entry. If this entry has an associated ptopoConnRemoteChassisType or ptopoConnRemotePortType value other than 'portIdGenAddr(4)' then the value 'notUsed(1)' is returned. Otherwise, one of the following conditions must be true: If the agent has not yet detected any network source addresses of the appropriate type from the remote port, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned. If the agent has detected exactly one network source address of the appropriate type from the remote port, then the value 'oneAddr(3)' is returned. If the agent has detected more than one network source address (of the same appropriate type) from the remote port, this the value 'multiAddr(4)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.1.1.1.14,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnIsStatic,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),This object identifies static ptopoConnEntries. If this object has the value 'true(1)', then this entry is not subject to any age-out mechanisms implemented by the agent. If this object has the value 'false(2)', then this entry is subject to all age-out mechanisms implemented by the agent. This object may not be modified if the associated ptopoConnRowStatus object has a value of active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.1.1.1.15,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnLastVerifyTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,If the associated value of ptopoConnIsStatic is equal to 'false(2)', then this object contains the value of sysUpTime at the time the conceptual row was last verified by the agent, e.g., via reception of a topology protocol message, pertaining to the associated remote chassis and port. If the associated value of ptopoConnIsStatic is equal to 'true(1)', then this object shall contain the value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last activated (i.e., ptopoConnRowStatus set to 'active(1)').

.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.2.1,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time a conceptual row is created, modified, or deleted in the ptopoConnTable. An NMS can use this object to reduce polling of the ptopoData group objects.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.2.2,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnTabInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an entry has been inserted into the ptopoConnTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.2.3,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnTabDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an entry has been deleted from the ptopoConnTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.2.4,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnTabDrops,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an entry would have been added to the ptopoConnTable, (e.g., via information learned from a topology protocol), but was not because of insufficient resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.2.5,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConnTabAgeouts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an entry has been deleted from the ptopoConnTable because the information timeliness interval for that entry has expired.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.3,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.3.1,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConfigTrapInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object controls the transmission of PTOPO notifications. If this object has a value of zero, then no ptopoConfigChange notifications will be transmitted by the agent. If this object has a non-zero value, then the agent must not generate more than one ptopoConfigChange trap-event in the indicated period, where a 'trap-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should periodically check the value of ptopoLastChangeTime to detect any missed ptopoConfigChange trap-events, e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss. If notification transmission is enabled, the suggested default throttling period is 60 seconds, but transmission should be disabled by default. If the agent is capable of storing non-volatile configuration, then the value of this object must be restored after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.1.3.2,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConfigMaxHoldTime,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object specifies the desired time interval for which an agent will maintain dynamic ptopoConnEntries. After the specified number of seconds since the last time an entry was verified, in the absence of new verification (e.g., receipt of a topology protocol message), the agent shall remove the entry. Note that entries may not always be removed immediately, but may possibly be removed at periodic garbage collection intervals. This object only affects dynamic ptopoConnEntries, i.e. for which ptopoConnIsStatic equals 'false(2)'. Static entries are not aged out. Note that dynamic ptopoConnEntries may also be removed by the agent due to the expired timeliness of learned topology information (e.g., timeliness interval for a remote port expires). The actual age-out interval for a given entry is defined by the following formula: age-out-time = min(ptopoConfigMaxHoldTime, <entry-specific hold-time>) where <entry-specific hold-time> is determined by the discovery algorithm, and may be different for each entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.2,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoMIBNotifications,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.2.0,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.2.0.1,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoConfigChange,,,,,,A ptopoConfigChange notification is sent when the value of ptopoLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger physical topology table maintenance polls. Note that transmission of ptopoConfigChange notifications are throttled by the agent, as specified by the 'ptopoConfigTrapInterval' object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.79.4.2.4,PTOPO-MIB::ptopoNotificationsGroup,,,,,,The collection of notifications used to indicate PTOPO MIB data consistency and general status information. This group is mandatory for agents which implement the PTOPO MIB.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.84,IANA-RTPROTO-MIB::ianaRtProtoMIB,,,,,,This MIB module defines the IANAipRouteProtocol and IANAipMRouteProtocol textual conventions for use in MIBs which need to identify unicast or multicast routing mechanisms. Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB module require either publication of an RFC, or Designated Expert Review as defined in RFC 2434, Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs. The Designated Expert will be selected by the IESG Area Director(s) of the Routing Area.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::notificationLogMIB,,,,,,The MIB module for logging SNMP Notifications, that is, Traps and Informs.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::notificationLogMIBObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit,Unsigned32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of notification entries that may be held in nlmLogTable for all nlmLogNames added together. A particular setting does not guarantee that much data can be held. If an application changes the limit while there are Notifications in the log, the oldest Notifications MUST be discarded to bring the log down to the new limit - thus the value of nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit MUST take precedence over the values of nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut and nlmConfigLogEntryLimit, even if the Notification being discarded has been present for fewer minutes than the value of nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut, or if the named log has fewer entries than that specified in nlmConfigLogEntryLimit. A value of 0 means no limit. Please be aware that contention between multiple managers trying to set this object to different values MAY affect the reliability and completeness of data seen by each manager.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.2,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut,Unsigned32,read-write,,current,,The number of minutes a Notification SHOULD be kept in a log before it is automatically removed. If an application changes the value of nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut, Notifications older than the new time MAY be discarded to meet the new time. A value of 0 means no age out. Please be aware that contention between multiple managers trying to set this object to different values MAY affect the reliability and completeness of data seen by each manager.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.3.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigLogEntry,,not-accessible,nlmLogName,current,,A logging control entry. Depending on the entry's storage type entries may be supplied by the system or created and deleted by applications using nlmConfigLogEntryStatus.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.3.1.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The name of the log. An implementation may allow multiple named logs, up to some implementation-specific limit (which may be none). A zero-length log name is reserved for creation and deletion by the managed system, and MUST be used as the default log name by systems that do not support named logs.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.3.1.2,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigLogFilterName,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A value of snmpNotifyFilterProfileName as used as an index into the snmpNotifyFilterTable in the SNMP Notification MIB, specifying the locally or remotely originated Notifications to be filtered out and not logged in this log. A zero-length value or a name that does not identify an existing entry in snmpNotifyFilterTable indicate no Notifications are to be logged in this log.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.3.1.3,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigLogEntryLimit,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of notification entries that can be held in nlmLogTable for this named log. A particular setting does not guarantee that that much data can be held. If an application changes the limit while there are Notifications in the log, the oldest Notifications are discarded to bring the log down to the new limit. A value of 0 indicates no limit. Please be aware that contention between multiple managers trying to set this object to different values MAY affect the reliability and completeness of data seen by each manager.

Please be aware that contention between multiple managers trying to set this object to different values MAY affect the reliability and completeness of data seen by each manager.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.3.1.5,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigLogOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,disabled(1):operational(2):noFilter(3),The operational status of this log: disabled administratively disabled operational administratively enabled and working noFilter administratively enabled but either nlmConfigLogFilterName is zero length or does not name an existing entry in snmpNotifyFilterTable
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.1.3.1.6,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmConfigLogStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type of this conceptual row.

Entries may be modified while active. For non-null-named logs, the managed system records the security credentials from the request that sets nlmConfigLogStatus to 'active' and uses that identity to apply access control to the objects in the Notification to decide if that Notification may be logged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.2,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmStats,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.2.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmStatsGlobalNotificationsLogged,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of Notifications put into the nlmLogTable. This counts a Notification once for each log entry, so a Notification put into multiple logs is counted multiple times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.2.2,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmStatsGlobalNotificationsBumped,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of log entries discarded to make room for a new entry due to lack of resources or the value of nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit or nlmConfigLogEntryLimit. This does not include entries discarded due to the value of nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.2.3,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmStatsLogTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of Notification log statistics entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.2.3.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmStatsLogEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,A Notification log statistics entry.

This does not include entries discarded due to the value of nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLog,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of Notification log entries. It is an implementation-specific matter whether entries in this table are preserved across initializations of the management system. In general one would expect that they are not. Note that keeping entries across initializations of the management system leads to some confusion with counters and TimeStamps, since both of those are based on sysUpTime, which resets on management initialization. In this situation, counters apply only after the reset and nlmLogTime for entries made before the reset MUST be set to 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogEntry,,not-accessible,nlmLogName:nlmLogIndex,current,,A Notification log entry. Entries appear in this table when Notifications occur and pass filtering by nlmConfigLogFilterName and access control. They are removed to make way for new entries due to lack of resources or the values of nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit, nlmConfigGlobalAgeOut, or nlmConfigLogEntryLimit. If adding an entry would exceed nlmConfigGlobalEntryLimit or system resources in general, the oldest entry in any log SHOULD be removed to make room for the new one. If adding an entry would exceed nlmConfigLogEntryLimit the oldest entry in that log SHOULD be removed to make room for the new one. Before the managed system puts a locally-generated Notification into a non-null-named log it assures that the creator of the log has access to the information in the Notification. If not it does not log that Notification in that log.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1.1.1,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogIndex,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,A monotonically increasing integer for the sole purpose of indexing entries within the named log. When it reaches the maximum value, an extremely unlikely event, the agent wraps the value back to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1.1.2,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the entry was placed in the log. If the entry occurred before the most recent management system initialization this object value MUST be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1.1.3,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogDateAndTime,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The local date and time when the entry was logged, instantiated only by systems that have date and time capability.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1.1.4,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The identification of the SNMP engine at which the Notification originated. If the log can contain Notifications from only one engine or the Trap is in SNMPv1 format, this object is a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.92.1.3.1.1.5,NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB::nlmLogEngineTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address of the SNMP engine from which the Notification was received, formatted according to the corresponding value of nlmLogEngineTDomain. This is used to identify the source of an SNMPv1 trap, since an nlmLogEngineId cannot be extracted from the SNMPv1 trap pdu. This object MUST always be instantiated, even if the log can contain Notifications from only one engine. Please be aware that the nlmLogEngineTAddress may not uniquely identify the SNMP engine from which the Notification was received. For example, if an SNMP engine uses DHCP or NAT to obtain ip addresses, the address it uses may be shared with other network devices, and hence will not uniquely identify the SNMP engine.

Although this seems to be unfriendly for IPv6, we have to recognize that there are a number of older MIBs that do contain an IPv4 format address, known as IpAddress. IPv6 addresses are represented using TAddress or InetAddress, and so the underlying datatype is OCTET STRING, and their value would be stored in the nlmLogVariableOctetStringVal column.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.99.1.1.1,ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB::entPhySensorEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical sensor. An entry in this table describes the present reading of a sensor, the measurement units and scale, and sensor operational status. Entries are created in this table by the agent. An entry for each physical sensor SHOULD be created at the same time as the associated entPhysicalEntry. An entry SHOULD be destroyed if the associated entPhysicalEntry is destroyed.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.0,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateNotifications,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.0.1,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateOperEnabled,,,,,,An entStateOperEnabled notification signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the entStateOper object for one of its entities has transitioned into the 'enabled' state. The entity this notification refers can be identified by extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the variable bindings. The entStateAdmin and entStateAlarm varbinds may be examined to find out additional information on the administrative state at the time of the operation state change as well as to find out whether there were any known alarms against the entity at that time that may explain why the physical entity has become operationally disabled.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.0.2,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateOperDisabled,,,,,,An entStateOperDisabled notification signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an agent role, has detected that the entStateOper object for one of its entities has transitioned into the 'disabled' state. The entity this notification refers can be identified by extracting the entPhysicalIndex from one of the variable bindings. The entStateAdmin and entStateAlarm varbinds may be examined to find out additional information on the administrative state at the time of the operation state change as well as to find out whether there were any known alarms against the entity at that time that may affect the physical entity's ability to stay operationally enabled.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of information about state/status of entities. This is a sparse augment of the entPhysicalTable. Entries appear in this table for values of entPhysicalClass [RFC 4133] that in this implementation are able to report any of the state or status stored in this table. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,State information about this physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateLastChanged,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The value of this object is the date and time when the value of any of entStateAdmin, entStateOper, entStateUsage, entStateAlarm, or entStateStandby changed for this entity. If there has been no change since the last re-initialization of the local system, this object contains the date and time of local system initialization. If there has been no change since the entity was added to the local system, this object contains the date and time of the insertion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateAdmin,INTEGER,read-write,,current,unknown(1):locked(2):shuttingDown(3):unlocked(4),The administrative state for this entity. This object refers to an entities administrative permission to service both other entities within its containment hierarchy as well other users of its services defined by means outside the scope of this MIB. Setting this object to 'notSupported' will result in an 'inconsistentValue' error. For entities that do not support administrative state, all set operations will result in an 'inconsistentValue' error. Some physical entities exhibit only a subset of the remaining administrative state values. Some entities cannot be locked, and hence this object exhibits only the 'unlocked' state. Other entities cannot be shutdown gracefully, and hence this object does not exhibit the 'shuttingDown' state. A value of 'inconsistentValue' will be returned if attempts are made to set this object to values not supported by its administrative model.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateOper,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(1):disabled(2):enabled(3):testing(4),The operational state for this entity. Note that unlike the state model used within the Interfaces MIB [RFC 2863], this object does not follow the administrative state. An administrative state of down does not predict an operational state of disabled. A value of 'testing' means that entity currently being tested and cannot therefore report whether it is operational or not. A value of 'disabled' means that an entity is totally inoperable and unable to provide service both to entities within its containment hierarchy, or to other receivers of its service as defined in ways outside the scope of this MIB. A value of 'enabled' means that an entity is fully or partially operable and able to provide service both to entities within its containment hierarchy, or to other receivers of its service as defined in ways outside the scope of this MIB. Note that some implementations may not be able to accurately report entStateOper while the entStateAdmin object has a value other than 'unlocked'. In these cases, this object MUST have a value of 'unknown'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateUsage,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(1):idle(2):active(3):busy(4),The usage state for this entity. This object refers to an entity's ability to service more physical entities in a containment hierarchy. A value of 'idle' means this entity is able to contain other entities but that no other entity is currently contained within this entity. A value of 'active' means that at least one entity is contained within this entity, but that it could handle more. A value of 'busy' means that the entity is unable to handle any additional entities being contained in it. Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the usage state values. Entities that are unable to ever service any entities within a containment hierarchy will always have a usage state of 'busy'. Some entities will only ever be able to support one entity within its containment hierarchy and will therefore only exhibit values of 'idle' and 'busy'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateAlarm,BITS,read-only,,current,unknown(0):underRepair(1):critical(2):major(3):minor(4):warning(5):indeterminate(6),The alarm status for this entity. It does not include the alarms raised on child components within its containment hierarchy. A value of 'unknown' means that this entity is unable to report alarm state. Note that this differs from 'indeterminate', which means that alarm state is supported and there are alarms against this entity, but the severity of some of the alarms is not known. If no bits are set, then this entity supports reporting of alarms, but there are currently no active alarms against this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.131.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-STATE-MIB::entStateStandby,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(1):hotStandby(2):coldStandby(3):providingService(4),The standby status for this entity. Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the remaining standby state values. If this entity cannot operate in a standby role, the value of this object will always be 'providingService'.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.12,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetMIB,,,,,,This MIB module defines MIB objects which provide mechanisms to remotely configure the parameters used by an SNMP entity for the generation of SNMP messages. Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2002). This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 3413; see the RFC itself for full legal notices. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,This object is used to facilitate modification of table entries in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB module by multiple managers. In particular, it is useful when modifying the value of the snmpTargetAddrTagList object. The procedure for modifying the snmpTargetAddrTagList object is as follows: 1. Retrieve the value of snmpTargetSpinLock and of snmpTargetAddrTagList. 2. Generate a new value for snmpTargetAddrTagList. 3. Set the value of snmpTargetSpinLock to the retrieved value, and the value of snmpTargetAddrTagList to the new value. If the set fails for the snmpTargetSpinLock object, go back to step 1.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of transport addresses to be used in the generation of SNMP messages.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrEntry,,not-accessible,IMPLIEDsnmpTargetAddrName,current,,A transport address to be used in the generation of SNMP operations. Entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable are created and deleted using the snmpTargetAddrRowStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The locally arbitrary, but unique identifier associated with this snmpTargetAddrEntry.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.2,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTDomain,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object indicates the transport type of the address contained in the snmpTargetAddrTAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.3,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object contains a transport address. The format of this address depends on the value of the snmpTargetAddrTDomain object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.4,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTimeout,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,This object should reflect the expected maximum round trip time for communicating with the transport address defined by this row. When a message is sent to this address, and a response (if one is expected) is not received within this time period, an implementation may assume that the response will not be delivered. Note that the time interval that an application waits for a response may actually be derived from the value of this object. The method for deriving the actual time interval is implementation dependent. One such method is to derive the expected round trip time based on a particular retransmission algorithm and on the number of timeouts which have occurred. The type of message may also be considered when deriving expected round trip times for retransmissions. For example, if a message is being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both authentication and privacy, the derived value may be increased to compensate for extra processing time spent during authentication and encryption processing.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.5,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrRetryCount,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This object specifies a default number of retries to be attempted when a response is not received for a generated message. An application may provide its own retry count, in which case the value of this object is ignored.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.6,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTagList,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object contains a list of tag values which are used to select target addresses for a particular operation.

To create a row in this table, a manager must set this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the snmpTargetAddrRowStatus column is 'notReady'. In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active until the corresponding instances of snmpTargetAddrTDomain, snmpTargetAddrTAddress, and snmpTargetAddrParams have all been set. The following objects may not be modified while the value of this object is active(1): - snmpTargetAddrTDomain - snmpTargetAddrTAddress An attempt to set these objects while the value of snmpTargetAddrRowStatus is active(1) will result in an inconsistentValue error.

To create a row in this table, a manager must set this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the snmpTargetParamsRowStatus column is 'notReady'. In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active until the corresponding snmpTargetParamsMPModel, snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel, snmpTargetParamsSecurityName, and snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel have all been set. The following objects may not be modified while the value of this object is active(1): - snmpTargetParamsMPModel - snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel - snmpTargetParamsSecurityName - snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel An attempt to set these objects while the value of snmpTargetParamsRowStatus is active(1) will result in an inconsistentValue error.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.13,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotificationMIB,,,,,,This MIB module defines MIB objects which provide mechanisms to remotely configure the parameters used by an SNMP entity for the generation of notifications. Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2002). This version of this MIB module is part of RFC 3413; see the RFC itself for full legal notices. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table is used to select management targets which should receive notifications, as well as the type of notification which should be sent to each selected management target.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.1.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyEntry,,not-accessible,IMPLIEDsnmpNotifyName,current,,An entry in this table selects a set of management targets which should receive notifications, as well as the type of notification which should be sent to each selected management target. Entries in the snmpNotifyTable are created and deleted using the snmpNotifyRowStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.1.1.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The locally arbitrary, but unique identifier associated with this snmpNotifyEntry.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.1.1.2,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyTag,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object contains a single tag value which is used to select entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable. Any entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable which contains a tag value which is equal to the value of an instance of this object is selected. If this object contains a value of zero length, no entries are selected.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.1.1.3,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,trap(1):inform(2),This object determines the type of notification to be generated for entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable selected by the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyTag. This value is only used when generating notifications, and is ignored when using the snmpTargetAddrTable for other purposes. If the value of this object is trap(1), then any messages generated for selected rows will contain Unconfirmed-Class PDUs. If the value of this object is inform(2), then any messages generated for selected rows will contain Confirmed-Class PDUs. Note that if an SNMP entity only supports generation of Unconfirmed-Class PDUs (and not Confirmed-Class PDUs), then this object may be read-only.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.1.1.4,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row.

To create a row in this table, a manager must set this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.2,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterProfileTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table is used to associate a notification filter profile with a particular set of target parameters.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.2.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterProfileEntry,,not-accessible,IMPLIEDsnmpTargetParamsName,current,,An entry in this table indicates the name of the filter profile to be used when generating notifications using the corresponding entry in the snmpTargetParamsTable. Entries in the snmpNotifyFilterProfileTable are created and deleted using the snmpNotifyFilterProfileRowStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.2.1.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterProfileName,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The name of the filter profile to be used when generating notifications using the corresponding entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.2.1.2,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterProfileStorType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row. Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write-access to any columnar objects in the row.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.2.1.3,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterProfileRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. To create a row in this table, a manager must set this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the snmpNotifyFilterProfileRowStatus column is 'notReady'. In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active until the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterProfileName has been set.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.3,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table of filter profiles. Filter profiles are used to determine whether particular management targets should receive particular notifications. When a notification is generated, it must be compared with the filters associated with each management target which is configured to receive notifications, in order to determine whether it may be sent to each such management target. A more complete discussion of notification filtering can be found in section 6. of [SNMP-APPL].
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.3.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterEntry,,not-accessible,snmpNotifyFilterProfileName:IMPLIEDsnmpNotifyFilterSubtree,current,,An element of a filter profile. Entries in the snmpNotifyFilterTable are created and deleted using the snmpNotifyFilterRowStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.3.1.1,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterSubtree,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The MIB subtree which, when combined with the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterMask, defines a family of subtrees which are included in or excluded from the filter profile.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.3.1.2,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The bit mask which, in combination with the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, defines a family of subtrees which are included in or excluded from the filter profile. Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-identifier of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, with the most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string value (extended if necessary, see below) corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16. Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER matches this family of filter subtrees; a '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches. Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is contained in a family of filter subtrees if, for each sub-identifier of the value of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, either: the i-th bit of snmpNotifyFilterMask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th sub-identifier of the value of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree. If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required length. Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of filter subtrees is the one subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of snmpNotifyFilterSubtree.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.13.1.3.1.3,SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB::snmpNotifyFilterType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,included(1):excluded(2),This object indicates whether the family of filter subtrees defined by this entry are included in or excluded from a filter. A more detailed discussion of the use of this object can be found in section 6. of [SNMP-APPL].

.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1.1,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmStatsUnsupportedSecLevels,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received by the SNMP engine which were dropped because they requested a securityLevel that was unknown to the SNMP engine or otherwise unavailable. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1.2,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmStatsNotInTimeWindows,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received by the SNMP engine which were dropped because they appeared outside of the authoritative SNMP engine's window. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1.3,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmStatsUnknownUserNames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received by the SNMP engine which were dropped because they referenced a user that was not known to the SNMP engine. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.1.4,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmStatsUnknownEngineIDs,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received by the SNMP engine which were dropped because they referenced an snmpEngineID that was not known to the SNMP engine.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.1,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow several cooperating Command Generator Applications to coordinate their use of facilities to alter secrets in the usmUserTable. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table of users configured in the SNMP engine's Local Configuration Datastore (LCD). To create a new user (i.e., to instantiate a new conceptual row in this table), it is recommended to follow this procedure: 1) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue. 2) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue, usmUserCloneFrom=templateUser, usmUserStatus=createAndWait) You should use a template user to clone from which has the proper auth/priv protocol defined. If the new user is to use privacy: 3) generate the keyChange value based on the secret privKey of the clone-from user and the secret key to be used for the new user. Let us call this pkcValue. 4) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue. 5) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue, usmUserPrivKeyChange=pkcValue usmUserPublic=randomValue1) 6) GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue1. If not, repeat steps 4-6. If the new user will never use privacy: 7) SET(usmUserPrivProtocol=usmNoPrivProtocol) If the new user is to use authentication: 8) generate the keyChange value based on the secret authKey of the clone-from user and the secret key to be used for the new user. Let us call this akcValue. 9) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue. 10) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue, usmUserAuthKeyChange=akcValue usmUserPublic=randomValue2) 11) GET(usmUserPulic) and check it has randomValue2. If not, repeat steps 9-11. If the new user will never use authentication: 12) SET(usmUserAuthProtocol=usmNoAuthProtocol) Finally, activate the new user: 13) SET(usmUserStatus=active) The new user should now be available and ready to be used for SNMPv3 communication. Note however that access to MIB data must be provided via configuration of the SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB. The use of usmUserSpinlock is to avoid conflicts with another SNMP command generator application which may also be acting on the usmUserTable. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserEntry,,not-accessible,usmUserEngineID:usmUserName,current,,A user configured in the SNMP engine's Local Configuration Datastore (LCD) for the User-based Security Model. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1.1,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserEngineID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,An SNMP engine's administratively-unique identifier. In a simple agent, this value is always that agent's own snmpEngineID value. The value can also take the value of the snmpEngineID of a remote SNMP engine with which this user can communicate. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1.2,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A human readable string representing the name of the user. This is the (User-based Security) Model dependent security ID. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1.3,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserSecurityName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A human readable string representing the user in Security Model independent format. The default transformation of the User-based Security Model dependent security ID to the securityName and vice versa is the identity function so that the securityName is the same as the userName. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1.4,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserCloneFrom,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,A pointer to another conceptual row in this usmUserTable. The user in this other conceptual row is called the clone-from user. When a new user is created (i.e., a new conceptual row is instantiated in this table), the privacy and authentication parameters of the new user must be cloned from its clone-from user. These parameters are: - authentication protocol (usmUserAuthProtocol) - privacy protocol (usmUserPrivProtocol) They will be copied regardless of what the current value is. Cloning also causes the initial values of the secret authentication key (authKey) and the secret encryption key (privKey) of the new user to be set to the same values as the corresponding secrets of the clone-from user to allow the KeyChange process to occur as required during user creation. The first time an instance of this object is set by a management operation (either at or after its instantiation), the cloning process is invoked. Subsequent writes are successful but invoke no action to be taken by the receiver. The cloning process fails with an 'inconsistentName' error if the conceptual row representing the clone-from user does not exist or is not in an active state when the cloning process is invoked. When this object is read, the ZeroDotZero OID is returned. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1.5,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserAuthProtocol,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,An indication of whether messages sent on behalf of this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by usmUserEngineID, can be authenticated, and if so, the type of authentication protocol which is used. An instance of this object is created concurrently with the creation of any other object instance for the same user (i.e., as part of the processing of the set operation which creates the first object instance in the same conceptual row). If an initial set operation (i.e. at row creation time) tries to set a value for an unknown or unsupported protocol, then a 'wrongValue' error must be returned. The value will be overwritten/set when a set operation is performed on the corresponding instance of usmUserCloneFrom. Once instantiated, the value of such an instance of this object can only be changed via a set operation to the value of the usmNoAuthProtocol. If a set operation tries to change the value of an existing instance of this object to any value other than usmNoAuthProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned. If a set operation tries to set the value to the usmNoAuthProtocol while the usmUserPrivProtocol value in the same row is not equal to usmNoPrivProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned. That means that an SNMP command generator application must first ensure that the usmUserPrivProtocol is set to the usmNoPrivProtocol value before it can set the usmUserAuthProtocol value to usmNoAuthProtocol. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.15.1.2.2.1.6,SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB::usmUserAuthKeyChange,OCTET,read-create,,current,,An object, which when modified, causes the secret authentication key used for messages sent on behalf of this user to/from the SNMP engine identified by usmUserEngineID, to be modified via a one-way function. The associated protocol is the usmUserAuthProtocol. The associated secret key is the user's secret authentication key (authKey). The associated hash algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's usmUserAuthProtocol. When creating a new user, it is an 'inconsistentName' error for a set operation to refer to this object unless it is previously or concurrently initialized through a set operation on the corresponding instance of usmUserCloneFrom. When the value of the corresponding usmUserAuthProtocol is usmNoAuthProtocol, then a set is successful, but effectively is a no-op. When this object is read, the zero-length (empty) string is returned. The recommended way to do a key change is as follows: 1) GET(usmUserSpinLock.0) and save in sValue. 2) generate the keyChange value based on the old (existing) secret key and the new secret key, let us call this kcValue. If you do the key change on behalf of another user: 3) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue, usmUserAuthKeyChange=kcValue usmUserPublic=randomValue) If you do the key change for yourself: 4) SET(usmUserSpinLock.0=sValue, usmUserOwnAuthKeyChange=kcValue usmUserPublic=randomValue) If you get a response with error-status of noError, then the SET succeeded and the new key is active. If you do not get a response, then you can issue a GET(usmUserPublic) and check if the value is equal to the randomValue you did send in the SET. If so, then the key change succeeded and the new key is active (probably the response got lost). If not, then the SET request probably never reached the target and so you can start over with the procedure above.

In addition, the USM security model must be used for this operation. The idea here is that access to this column can be public, since it will only allow a user to change his own secret authentication key (authKey). Note that this can only be done once the row is active. When a set is received and the usmUserName of the requester is not the same as the umsUserName that indexes the row which is targeted by this operation, then a 'noAccess' error must be returned.

An instance of this object is created concurrently with the creation of any other object instance for the same user (i.e., as part of the processing of the set operation which creates the first object instance in the same conceptual row). If an initial set operation (i.e. at row creation time) tries to set a value for an unknown or unsupported protocol, then a 'wrongValue' error must be returned. The value will be overwritten/set when a set operation is performed on the corresponding instance of usmUserCloneFrom. Once instantiated, the value of such an instance of this object can only be changed via a set operation to the value of the usmNoPrivProtocol. If a set operation tries to change the value of an existing instance of this object to any value other than usmNoPrivProtocol, then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned. Note that if any privacy protocol is used, then you must also use an authentication protocol. In other words, if usmUserPrivProtocol is set to anything else than usmNoPrivProtocol, then the corresponding instance of usmUserAuthProtocol cannot have a value of usmNoAuthProtocol. If it does, then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned.

The associated hash algorithm is the algorithm used by the user's usmUserAuthProtocol. When creating a new user, it is an 'inconsistentName' error for a set operation to refer to this object unless it is previously or concurrently initialized through a set operation on the corresponding instance of usmUserCloneFrom.

Note that any user who employs authentication or privacy must allow its secret(s) to be updated and thus cannot be 'readOnly'. If an initial set operation tries to set the value to 'readOnly' for a user who employs authentication or privacy, then an 'inconsistentValue' error must be returned. Note that if the value has been previously set (implicit or explicit) to any value, then the rules as defined in the StorageType Textual Convention apply. It is an implementation issue to decide if a SET for a readOnly or permanent row is accepted at all. In some contexts this may make sense, in others it may not. If a SET for a readOnly or permanent row is not accepted at all, then a 'wrongValue' error must be returned.

This table provides information to SNMP Command Generator applications so that they can properly configure the vacmAccessTable to control access to all contexts at the SNMP entity. This table may change dynamically if the SNMP entity allows that contexts are added/deleted dynamically (for instance when its configuration changes). Such changes would happen only if the management instrumentation at that SNMP entity recognizes more (or fewer) contexts. The presence of entries in this table and of entries in the vacmAccessTable are independent. That is, a context identified by an entry in this table is not necessarily referenced by any entries in the vacmAccessTable; and the context(s) referenced by an entry in the vacmAccessTable does not necessarily currently exist and thus need not be identified by an entry in this table. This table must be made accessible via the default context so that Command Responder applications have a standard way of retrieving the information. This table is read-only.

Each entry is indexed by a groupName, a contextPrefix, a securityModel and a securityLevel. To determine whether access is allowed, one entry from this table needs to be selected and the proper viewName from that entry must be used for access control checking. To select the proper entry, follow these steps: 1) the set of possible matches is formed by the intersection of the following sets of entries: the set of entries with identical vacmGroupName the union of these two sets: - the set with identical vacmAccessContextPrefix - the set of entries with vacmAccessContextMatch value of 'prefix' and matching vacmAccessContextPrefix intersected with the union of these two sets: - the set of entries with identical vacmSecurityModel - the set of entries with vacmSecurityModel value of 'any' intersected with the set of entries with vacmAccessSecurityLevel value less than or equal to the requested securityLevel 2) if this set has only one member, we're done otherwise, it comes down to deciding how to weight the preferences between ContextPrefixes, SecurityModels, and SecurityLevels as follows: a) if the subset of entries with securityModel matching the securityModel in the message is not empty, then discard the rest. b) if the subset of entries with vacmAccessContextPrefix matching the contextName in the message is not empty, then discard the rest c) discard all entries with ContextPrefixes shorter than the longest one remaining in the set d) select the entry with the highest securityLevel Please note that for securityLevel noAuthNoPriv, all groups are really equivalent since the assumption that the securityName has been authenticated does not hold.

When creating a new view or altering an existing view, it is important to understand the potential interactions with other uses of the view. The vacmViewSpinLock should be retrieved. The name of the view to be created should be determined to be unique by the SNMP Command Generator application by consulting the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable. Finally, the named view may be created (Set), including the advisory lock. If another SNMP Command Generator application has altered the views in the meantime, then the spin lock's value will have changed, and so this creation will fail because it will specify the wrong value for the spin lock. Since this is an advisory lock, the use of this lock is not enforced. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.16.1.5.2,SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmViewTreeFamilyTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Locally held information about families of subtrees within MIB views. Each MIB view is defined by two sets of view subtrees: - the included view subtrees, and - the excluded view subtrees. Every such view subtree, both the included and the excluded ones, is defined in this table. To determine if a particular object instance is in a particular MIB view, compare the object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER with each of the MIB view's active entries in this table. If none match, then the object instance is not in the MIB view. If one or more match, then the object instance is included in, or excluded from, the MIB view according to the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyType in the entry whose value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree has the most sub-identifiers. If multiple entries match and have the same number of sub-identifiers (when wildcarding is specified with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask), then the lexicographically greatest instance of vacmViewTreeFamilyType determines the inclusion or exclusion. An object instance's OBJECT IDENTIFIER X matches an active entry in this table when the number of sub-identifiers in X is at least as many as in the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree for the entry, and each sub-identifier in the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree matches its corresponding sub-identifier in X. Two sub-identifiers match either if the corresponding bit of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask for the entry is zero (the 'wild card' value), or if they are equal. A 'family' of subtrees is the set of subtrees defined by a particular combination of values of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask. In the case where no 'wild card' is defined in the vacmViewTreeFamilyMask, the family of subtrees reduces to a single subtree. When creating or changing MIB views, an SNMP Command Generator application should utilize the vacmViewSpinLock to try to avoid collisions. Seeclause of vacmViewSpinLock. When creating MIB views, it is strongly advised that first the 'excluded' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are created and then the 'included' entries. When deleting MIB views, it is strongly advised that first the 'included' vacmViewTreeFamilyEntries are deleted and then the 'excluded' entries. If a create for an entry for instance-level access control is received and the implementation does not support instance-level granularity, then an inconsistentName error must be returned. 
.1.3.6.1.6.3.16.1.5.2.1,SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmViewTreeFamilyEntry,,not-accessible,vacmViewTreeFamilyViewName:vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree,current,,Information on a particular family of view subtrees included in or excluded from a particular SNMP context's MIB view. Implementations must not restrict the number of families of view subtrees for a given MIB view, except as dictated by resource constraints on the overall number of entries in the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable. If no conceptual rows exist in this table for a given MIB view (viewName), that view may be thought of as consisting of the empty set of view subtrees.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.16.1.5.2.1.3,SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmViewTreeFamilyMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The bit mask which, in combination with the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, defines a family of view subtrees. Each bit of this bit mask corresponds to a sub-identifier of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, with the most significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string value (extended if necessary, see below) corresponding to the (8*i - 7)-th sub-identifier, and the least significant bit of the i-th octet of this octet string corresponding to the (8*i)-th sub-identifier, where i is in the range 1 through 16. Each bit of this bit mask specifies whether or not the corresponding sub-identifiers must match when determining if an OBJECT IDENTIFIER is in this family of view subtrees; a '1' indicates that an exact match must occur; a '0' indicates 'wild card', i.e., any sub-identifier value matches. Thus, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER X of an object instance is contained in a family of view subtrees if, for each sub-identifier of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, either: the i-th bit of vacmViewTreeFamilyMask is 0, or the i-th sub-identifier of X is equal to the i-th sub-identifier of the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree. If the value of this bit mask is M bits long and there are more than M sub-identifiers in the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree, then the bit mask is extended with 1's to be the required length. Note that when the value of this object is the zero-length string, this extension rule results in a mask of all-1's being used (i.e., no 'wild card'), and the family of view subtrees is the one view subtree uniquely identified by the corresponding instance of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree. Note that masks of length greater than zero length do not need to be supported. In this case this object is made read-only.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.2,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunityName,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The community string for which a row in this table represents a configuration. There is no SIZE constraint specified for this object because RFC 1157 does not impose any explicit limitation on the length of community strings (their size is constrained indirectly by the SNMP message size).
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.3,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunitySecurityName,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A human readable string representing the corresponding value of snmpCommunityName in a Security Model independent format.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.4,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunityContextEngineID,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The contextEngineID indicating the location of the context in which management information is accessed when using the community string specified by the corresponding instance of snmpCommunityName. The default value is the snmpEngineID of the entity in which this object is instantiated.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.5,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunityContextName,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The context in which management information is accessed when using the community string specified by the corresponding instance of snmpCommunityName.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.6,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunityTransportTag,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object specifies a set of transport endpoints which are used in two ways: - to specify the transport endpoints from which an SNMP entity will accept management requests, and - to specify the transport endpoints to which a notification may be sent using the community string matching the corresponding instance of snmpCommunityName. In either case, if the value of this object has zero-length, transport endpoints are not checked when either authenticating messages containing this community string, nor when generating notifications. The transports identified by this object are specified in the snmpTargetAddrTable. Entries in that table whose snmpTargetAddrTagList contains this tag value are identified. If a management request containing a community string that matches the corresponding instance of snmpCommunityName is received on a transport endpoint other than the transport endpoints identified by this object the request is deemed unauthentic. When a notification is to be sent using an entry in this table, if the destination transport endpoint of the notification does not match one of the transport endpoints selected by this object, the notification is not sent.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.7,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunityStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row in the snmpCommunityTable. Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write-access to any columnar object in the row.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.1.1.8,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpCommunityStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row in the snmpCommunityTable. An entry in this table is not qualified for activation until instances of all corresponding columns have been initialized, either through default values, or through Set operations. The snmpCommunityName and snmpCommunitySecurityName objects must be explicitly set. There is no restriction on setting columns in this table when the value of snmpCommunityStatus is active(1).
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.2,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpTargetAddrExtTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table of mask and maximum message size (mms) values associated with the snmpTargetAddrTable. The snmpTargetAddrExtTable augments the snmpTargetAddrTable with a transport address mask value and a maximum message size value. The transport address mask allows entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable to define a set of addresses instead of just a single address. The maximum message size value allows the maximum message size of another SNMP entity to be configured for use in SNMPv1 (and SNMPv2c) transactions, where the message format does not specify a maximum message size.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.2.1,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpTargetAddrExtEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,Information about a particular mask and mms value.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.2.1.1,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask value associated with an entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable. The value of this object must have the same length as the corresponding instance of snmpTargetAddrTAddress, or must have length 0. An attempt to set it to any other value will result in an inconsistentValue error. The value of this object allows an entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable to specify multiple addresses. The mask value is used to select which bits of a transport address must match bits of the corresponding instance of snmpTargetAddrTAddress, in order for the transport address to match a particular entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable. Bits which are 1 in the mask value indicate bits in the transport address which must match bits in the snmpTargetAddrTAddress value. Bits which are 0 in the mask indicate bits in the transport address which need not match. If the length of the mask is 0, the mask should be treated as if all its bits were 1 and its length were equal to the length of the corresponding value of snmpTargetAddrTable. This object may not be modified while the value of the corresponding instance of snmpTargetAddrRowStatus is active(1). An attempt to set this object in this case will result in an inconsistentValue error.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.2.1.2,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpTargetAddrMMS,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum message size value associated with an entry in the snmpTargetAddrTable. Note that a value of 0 means that the maximum message size is unknown.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.3,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpTrapAddress,IpAddress,accessible-for-notify,,current,,The value of the agent-addr field of a Trap PDU which is forwarded by a proxy forwarder application using an SNMP version other than SNMPv1. The value of this object SHOULD contain the value of the agent-addr field from the original Trap PDU as generated by an SNMPv1 agent.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.18.1.4,SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB::snmpTrapCommunity,OCTET,accessible-for-notify,,current,,The value of the community string field of an SNMPv1 message containing a Trap PDU which is forwarded by a a proxy forwarder application using an SNMP version other than SNMPv1. The value of this object SHOULD contain the value of the community string field from the original SNMPv1 message containing a Trap PDU as generated by an SNMPv1 agent. There is no SIZE constraint specified for this object because RFC 1157 does not impose any explicit limitation on the length of community strings (their size is constrained indirectly by the SNMP message size).
