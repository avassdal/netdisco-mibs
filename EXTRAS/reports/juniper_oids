.1.0.8802.1.1.2.0.0.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTablesChange,,,,,,A lldpRemTablesChange notification is sent when the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger LLDP remote systems table maintenance polls. Note that transmission of lldpRemTablesChange notifications are throttled by the agent, as specified by the 'lldpNotificationInterval' object.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpObjects,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfiguration,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The interval at which LLDP frames are transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent. The default value for lldpMessageTxInterval object is 30 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The time-to-live value expressed as a multiple of the lldpMessageTxInterval object. The actual time-to-live value used in LLDP frames, transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent, can be expressed by the following formula: TTL = min(65535, (lldpMessageTxInterval * lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier)) For example, if the value of lldpMessageTxInterval is '30', and the value of lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier is '4', then the value '120' is encoded in the TTL field in the LLDP header. The default value for lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier object is 4. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpReinitDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpReinitDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) from when lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object of a particular port becomes 'disabled' until re-initialization will be attempted. The default value for lldpReintDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpTxDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpTxDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) between successive LLDP frame transmissions  initiated by value/status changes in the LLDP local systems MIB. The recommended value for the lldpTxDelay is set by the following formula: 1 <= lldpTxDelay <= (0.25 * lldpMessageTxInterval) The default value for lldpTxDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.5,LLDP-MIB::lldpNotificationInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object controls the transmission of LLDP notifications. the agent must not generate more than one lldpRemTablesChange notification-event in the indicated period, where a 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional changes in lldpRemoteSystemsData object groups occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should periodically check the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime to detect any missed lldpRemTablesChange notification-events, e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss. If notification transmission is enabled for particular ports, the suggested default throttling period is 5 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls LLDP frame transmission on individual ports.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigEntry,,not-accessible,lldpPortConfigPortNum,current,,LLDP configuration information for a particular port. This configuration parameter controls the transmission and the reception of LLDP frames on those ports whose rows are created in this table.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpPortConfigTable.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,txOnly(1):rxOnly(2):txAndRx(3):disabled(4),The administratively desired status of the local LLDP agent. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txOnly(1)', then LLDP agent will transmit LLDP frames on this port and it will not store any information about the remote systems connected.  If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'rxOnly(2)', then the LLDP agent will receive, but it will not transmit LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txAndRx(3)', then the LLDP agent will transmit and receive LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'disabled(4)', then LLDP agent will not transmit or receive LLDP frames on this port. If there is remote systems information which is received on this port and stored in other tables, before the port's lldpPortConfigAdminStatus becomes disabled, then the information will naturally age out.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),The lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable controls, on a per port basis, whether or not notifications from the agent are enabled. The value true(1) means that notifications are enabled; the value false(2) means that they are not.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable,BITS,read-write,,current,portDesc(0):sysName(1):sysDesc(2):sysCap(3),The lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable, defined as a bitmap, includes the basic set of LLDP TLVs whose transmission is allowed on the local LLDP agent by the network management. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a TLV type associated with a specific optional TLV. It should be noted that the organizationally-specific TLVs are excluded from the lldpTLVsTxEnable bitmap.  LLDP Organization Specific Information Extension MIBs should have similar configuration object to control transmission of their organizationally defined TLVs. The bit 'portDesc(0)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'Port Description TLV'. The bit 'sysName(1)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Name TLV'. The bit 'sysDesc(2)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Description TLV'. The bit 'sysCap(3)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Capabilities TLV'. There is no bit reserved for the management address TLV type since transmission of management address TLVs are controlled by another object, lldpConfigManAddrTable. The default value for lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable object is empty set, which means no enumerated values are set. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls selection of LLDP management address TLV instances to be transmitted on individual ports.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,LLDP configuration information that specifies the set of ports (represented as a PortList) on which the local system management address instance will be transmitted. This configuration object augments the lldpLocManAddrEntry, therefore it is only present along with the management address instance contained in the associated lldpLocManAddrEntry entry. Each active lldpConfigManAddrEntry must be restored from non-volatile and re-created (along with the corresponding lldpLocManAddrEntry) after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable,OCTET,read-write,,current,,A set of ports that are identified by a PortList, in which each port is represented as a bit. The corresponding local system management address instance will be transmitted on the member ports of the lldpManAddrPortsTxEnable.  The default value for lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable object is empty binary string, which means no ports are specified for advertising indicated management address instance.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatistics,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime object (defined in IETF RFC 3418) at the time an entry is created, modified, or deleted in the in tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems. An NMS can use this object to reduce polling of the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesInserts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been inserted into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. The complete set of information received from a particular MSAP should be inserted into related tables. If partial information cannot be inserted for a reason such as lack of resources, all of the complete set of information should be removed. This counter should be incremented only once after the complete set of information is successfully recorded in all related tables. Any failures during inserting information set which result in deletion of previously inserted information should not trigger any changes in lldpStatsRemTablesInserts since the insert is not completed yet or or in lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes, since the deletion would only be a partial deletion. If the failure was the result of lack of resources, the lldpStatsRemTablesDrops counter should be incremented once.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely deleted from all related tables. Partial deletions, such as deletion of rows associated with a particular MSAP from some tables, but not from all tables are not allowed, thus should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDrops,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP could not be entered into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because of insufficient resources.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.5,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because the information timeliness interval has expired. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely invalidated (aged out) from all related tables. Partial aging, similar to deletion case, is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table containing LLDP transmission statistics for individual ports. Entries are not required to exist in this table while the lldpPortConfigEntry object is equal to 'disabled(4)'.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortEntry,,not-accessible,lldpStatsTxPortNum,current,,LLDP frame transmission statistics for a particular port.  The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortEntry,,not-accessible,lldpStatsRxPortNum,current,,LLDP frame reception statistics for a particular port. The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpStatsTable.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortFramesDiscardedTotal,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of LLDP frames received by this LLDP agent on the indicated port, and then discarded for any reason. This counter can provide an indication that LLDP header formating problems may exist with the local LLDP agent in the sending system or that LLDPDU validation problems may exist with the local LLDP agent in the receiving system.

An unrecognized TLV is referred to as the TLV whose type value is in the range of reserved TLV types (000 1001 - 111 1110) in Table 9.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AB-2005. An unrecognized TLV may be a basic management TLV from a later LLDP version.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The counter that represents the number of age-outs that occurred on a given port. An age-out is the number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because the information timeliness interval has expired. This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except that the counter is on a per port basis. This enables NMS to poll tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems on the indicated port only. This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage. When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to 'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with the same port should reset to 0. The agent should also flush all remote system information associated with the same port. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from all related tables on a particular port. Partial aging is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.4.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one or more rows per physical network connection known to this agent. The agent may wish to ensure that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for the same local port. The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote systems information updates from an LLDP agent: 1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved. NMS polls periodically the values of the following objects: a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports. 2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and sends out notifications to a list of notification destinations. 3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new values of objects listed in step 1.  Periodically, NMS should poll the object lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything has changed since the last poll. if something has changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed, then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter with the last-polled time value. This request will return new objects or objects whose values are updated since the last poll. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed, then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and compare the new values with previously recorded ones. For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to retrieve objects associated with those ports from table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.) lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes and lldpStatsRemTablesDrops objects are provided for informational purposes.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17,IF-MIB::ifOutUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IPv4 routers forward datagrams. IPv4 hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). When this object is written, the entity should save the change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,IP-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IPv4 header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol. When this object is written, the entity should save the change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3,IP-MIB::ipInReceives,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of input datagrams received from interfaces, including those received in error. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInRecieves.

It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInHdrErrors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,IP-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IPv4 address in their IPv4 header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IPv4 routers, and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInAddrErrors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,IP-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IPv4 destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IPv4 routers, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source-Route option processing was successful. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInForwDatagrams.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,IP-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.11,IP-MIB::ipOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of output IPv4 datagrams for which no problem was encountered to prevent their transmission to their destination, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsOutDiscards.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,IP-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of IPv4 datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagrams which a host cannot route because all of its default routers are down. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsOutNoRoutes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,IP-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of seconds that received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16,IP-MIB::ipReasmFails,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of failures detected by the IPv4 re-assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IPv4 fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsReasmFails.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17,IP-MIB::ipFragOKs,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of IPv4 datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsOutFragOKs.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcast addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteDest,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The destination IP address of this route. An entry with a value of 0.0.0.0 is considered a default route. Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric1,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The primary routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric2,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric3,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteType,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,other(1):invalid(2):direct(3):indirect(4),The type of route. Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipRouteType object.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0. It should be noted that all IP routing subsystems implicitly use this mechanism.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric5,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaEntry,,not-accessible,ipNetToMediaIfIndex:ipNetToMediaNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one IpAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaIfIndex,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex. This object predates the rule limiting index objects to a max access value of 'not-accessible' and so continues to use a value of 'read-create'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaPhysAddress,OCTET,read-create,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. This object should return 0 when this entry is in the 'incomplete' state. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.3,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaNetAddress,IpAddress,read-create,,deprecated,,The IpAddress corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address. This object predates the rule limiting index objects to a max access value of 'not-accessible' and so continues to use a value of 'read-create'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.4,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaType,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dis-associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation- specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,IP-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries. This object was defined in pre-IPv6 versions of the IP MIB. It was implicitly IPv4 only, but the original specifications did not indicate this protocol restriction. In order to clarify the specifications, this object has been deprecated and a similar, but more thoroughly clarified, object has been added to the IP-FORWARD-MIB.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.41,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsHCOutMcastOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted in IP multicast datagrams. This object counts the same octets as ipIfStatsOutMcastOctets, but allows for larger values. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.42,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsInBcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of IP broadcast datagrams received. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.43,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsHCInBcastPkts,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The number of IP broadcast datagrams received. This object counts the same datagrams as ipIfStatsInBcastPkts, but allows for larger values. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.44,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsOutBcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of IP broadcast datagrams transmitted. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.45,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsHCOutBcastPkts,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The number of IP broadcast datagrams transmitted. This object counts the same datagrams as ipIfStatsOutBcastPkts, but allows for larger values. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.46,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this entry's counters suffered a discontinuity. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.3.1.47,IP-MIB::ipIfStatsRefreshRate,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The minimum reasonable polling interval for this entry. This object provides an indication of the minimum amount of time required to update the counters in this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table allows the user to determine the source of an IP address or set of IP addresses, and allows other tables to share the information via pointer rather than by copying. For example, when the node configures both a unicast and anycast address for a prefix, the ipAddressPrefix objects for those addresses will point to a single row in this table. This table primarily provides support for IPv6 prefixes, and several of the objects are less meaningful for IPv4. The table continues to allow IPv4 addresses to allow future flexibility. In order to promote a common configuration, this document includes suggestions for default values for IPv4 prefixes. Each of these values may be overridden if an object is meaningful to the node. All prefixes used by this entity should be included in this table independent of how the entity learned the prefix. (This table isn't limited to prefixes learned from router advertisements.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixEntry,,not-accessible,ipAddressPrefixIfIndex:ipAddressPrefixType:ipAddressPrefixPrefix:ipAddressPrefixLength,current,,An entry in the ipAddressPrefixTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface on which this prefix is configured. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.2,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of ipAddressPrefix.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.3,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixPrefix,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The address prefix. The address type of this object is specified in ipAddressPrefixType. The length of this object is the standard length for objects of that type (4 or 16 bytes). Any bits after ipAddressPrefixLength must be zero. Implementors need to be aware that, if the size of ipAddressPrefixPrefix exceeds 114 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.4,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixLength,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The prefix length associated with this prefix. The value 0 has no special meaning for this object. It simply refers to address '::/0'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.5,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixOrigin,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):manual(2):wellknown(3):dhcp(4):routeradv(5),The origin of this prefix.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.6,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixOnLinkFlag,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has the value 'true(1)', if this prefix can be used for on-link determination; otherwise, the value is 'false(2)'. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 'true(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.7,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAutonomousFlag,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),Autonomous address configuration flag. When true(1), indicates that this prefix can be used for autonomous address configuration (i.e., can be used to form a local interface address). If false(2), it is not used to auto- configure a local interface address. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 'false(2)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.8,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAdvPreferredLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be preferred, i.e., time until deprecation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from a deprecated prefix should no longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets received on such an interface are processed as expected. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 4,294,967,295 (infinity).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.9,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAdvValidLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be valid, i.e., time until invalidation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from an invalidated prefix should not appear as the destination or source address of a packet. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 4,294,967,295 (infinity).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.33,IP-MIB::ipAddressSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP managers to coordinate their use of the set operation in creating or modifying rows within this table. In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipAddressTableSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command, including the retrieved value of ipAddressSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipAddressSpinLock will have changed, and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipAddressSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipAddressSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34,IP-MIB::ipAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains addressing information relevant to the entity's interfaces. This table does not contain multicast address information. Tables for such information should be contained in multicast specific MIBs, such as RFC 3019. While this table is writable, the user will note that several objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not. The intention in allowing a user to write to this table is to allow them to add or remove any entry that isn't permanent. The user should be allowed to modify objects and entries when that would not cause inconsistencies within the table. Allowing write access to objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, could allow a user to insert an entry and then label it incorrectly. Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this table, the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in order to differentiate between the possible interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressEntry,,not-accessible,ipAddressAddrType:ipAddressAddr,current,,An address mapping for a particular interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressAddrType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of ipAddressAddr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.2,IP-MIB::ipAddressAddr,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP address to which this entry's addressing information pertains. The address type of this object is specified in ipAddressAddrType. Implementors need to be aware that if the size of ipAddressAddr exceeds 116 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.3,IP-MIB::ipAddressIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.4,IP-MIB::ipAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,unicast(1):anycast(2):broadcast(3),The type of address. broadcast(3) is not a valid value for IPv6 addresses (RFC 3513).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.5,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefix,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,A pointer to the row in the prefix table to which this address belongs. May be { 0 0 } if there is no such row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.6,IP-MIB::ipAddressOrigin,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):manual(2):dhcp(4):linklayer(5):random(6),The origin of the address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.7,IP-MIB::ipAddressStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,preferred(1):deprecated(2):invalid(3):inaccessible(4):unknown(5):tentative(6):duplicate(7):optimistic(8),The status of the address, describing if the address can be used for communication. In the absence of other information, an IPv4 address is always preferred(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.8,IP-MIB::ipAddressCreated,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was created. If this entry was created prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.9,IP-MIB::ipAddressLastChanged,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last updated. If this entry was updated prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.10,IP-MIB::ipAddressRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. The RowStatus TC requires that this DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances other objects in this row can be modified. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. A conceptual row can not be made active until the ipAddressIfIndex has been set to a valid index.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.11,IP-MIB::ipAddressStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row. If this object has a value of 'permanent', then no other objects are required to be able to be modified.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The IP Address Translation table used for mapping from IP addresses to physical addresses. The Address Translation tables contain the IP address to 'physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries. While many protocols may be used to populate this table, ARP and Neighbor Discovery are the most likely options.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,ipNetToPhysicalIfIndex:ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType:ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress,current,,Each entry contains one IP address to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.2,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The type of ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.3,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP Address corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address. The address type of this object is specified in ipNetToPhysicalAddressType. Implementors need to be aware that if the size of ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress exceeds 115 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.4,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The media-dependent `physical' address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.5,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalLastUpdated,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last updated. If this entry was updated prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.6,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4):local(5),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToPhysicalTable. That is, it effectively dis- associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType object. The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol. The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been statically configured. Both of these refer to entries that provide mappings for other entities addresses. The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided for an entity's own interface address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.7,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalState,INTEGER,read-only,,current,reachable(1):stale(2):delay(3):probe(4):invalid(5):unknown(6):incomplete(7),The Neighbor Unreachability Detection state for the interface when the address mapping in this entry is used. If Neighbor Unreachability Detection is not in use (e.g. for IPv4), this object is always unknown(6).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.8,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. The RowStatus TC requires that this DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances other objects in this row can be modified. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. A conceptual row can not be made active until the ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress object has been set. Note that if the ipNetToPhysicalType is set to 'invalid', the managed node may delete the entry independent of the state of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.36,IP-MIB::ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table used to describe IPv6 unicast and multicast scope zones. For those objects that have names rather than numbers, the names were chosen to coincide with the names used in the IPv6 address architecture document.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.2,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP address of the default router represented by this row. The address type of this object is specified in ipDefaultRouterAddressType. Implementers need to be aware that if the size of ipDefaultRouterAddress exceeds 115 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.3,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface by which the router can be reached. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.4,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this router will continue to be useful as a default router. A value of zero indicates that it is no longer useful as a default router. It is left to the implementer of the MIB as to whether a router with a lifetime of zero is removed from the list. For IPv6, this value should be extracted from the router advertisement messages.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.5,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterPreference,INTEGER,read-only,,current,reserved(-2):low(-1):medium(0):high(1),An indication of preference given to this router as a default router as described in he Default Router Preferences document. Treating the value as a 2 bit signed integer allows for simple arithmetic comparisons. For IPv4 routers or IPv6 routers that are not using the updated router advertisement format, this object is set to medium (0).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.38,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP managers to coordinate their use of the set operation in creating or modifying rows within this table. In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command including the retrieved value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock will have changed and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.39,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information used to construct router advertisements.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.39.1,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertEntry,,not-accessible,ipv6RouterAdvertIfIndex,current,,An entry containing information used to construct router advertisements.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection.

If this associated entry in ifTable is operationally disabled (thus removing MPLS capabilities on that interface), the corresponding entry in this table MUST be deleted shortly thereafter. An conceptual row with index 0 is created if the LSR supports per-platform labels. This conceptual row represents the per-platform label space and contains parameters that apply to all interfaces that participate in the per-platform label space. Other conceptual rows in this table represent MPLS interfaces that may participate in either the per-platform or per- interface label spaces, or both. Implementations that either only support per-platform labels, or have only them configured, may choose to return just the mplsInterfaceEntry of 0 and not return the other rows. This will greatly reduce the number of objects returned. Further information about label space participation of an interface is provided in the DESCRIPTION clause of mplsInterfaceLabelParticipationType.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,This is a unique index for an entry in the MplsInterfaceTable. A non-zero index for an entry indicates the ifIndex for the corresponding interface entry of the MPLS-layer in the ifTable. The entry with index 0 represents the per-platform label space and contains parameters that apply to all interfaces that participate in the per-platform label space. Other entries defined in this table represent additional MPLS interfaces that may participate in either the per-platform or per-interface label spaces, or both.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMinIn,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the minimum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to receive on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the maximum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to receive on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMinOut,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the minimum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to send on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the maximum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to send on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceTotalBandwidth,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This value indicates the total amount of usable bandwidth on this interface and is specified in kilobits per second (Kbps). This variable is not applicable when applied to the interface with index 0. When this value cannot be measured, this value should contain the nominal bandwidth.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceAvailableBandwidth,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This value indicates the total amount of available bandwidth available on this interface and is specified in kilobits per second (Kbps). This value is calculated as the difference between the amount of bandwidth currently in use and that specified in mplsInterfaceTotalBandwidth. This variable is not applicable when applied to the interface with index 0. When this value cannot be measured, this value should contain the nominal bandwidth.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.8,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelParticipationType,BITS,read-only,,current,perPlatform(0):perInterface(1),If the value of the mplsInterfaceIndex for this entry is zero, then this entry corresponds to the per-platform label space for all interfaces configured to use that label space. In this case the perPlatform(0) bit MUST be set; the perInterface(1) bit is meaningless and MUST be ignored. The remainder of this description applies to entries with a non-zero value of mplsInterfaceIndex. If the perInterface(1) bit is set then the value of mplsInterfaceLabelMinIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMinOut, and mplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut for this entry reflect the label ranges for this interface. If only the perPlatform(0) bit is set, then the value of mplsInterfaceLabelMinIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMinOut, and mplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut for this entry MUST be identical to the instance of these objects with index 0. These objects may only vary from the entry with index 0 if both the perPlatform(0) and perInterface(1) bits are set. In all cases, at a minimum one of the perPlatform(0) or perInterface(1) bits MUST be set to indicate that at least one label space is in use by this interface. In all cases, agents MUST ensure that label ranges are specified consistently and MUST return an inconsistentValue error when they do not.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table provides MPLS performance information on a per-interface basis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry in this table is created by the LSR for every interface capable of supporting MPLS. Its is an extension to the mplsInterfaceEntry table. Note that the discontinuity behavior of entries in this table MUST be based on the corresponding ifEntry's ifDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfInLabelsInUse,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of labels that are in use at this point in time on this interface in the incoming direction. If the interface participates in only the per-platform label space, then the value of the instance of this object MUST be identical to the value of the instance with index 0. If the interface participates in the per-interface label space, then the instance of this object MUST represent the number of per-interface labels that are in use on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfInLabelLookupFailures,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of labeled packets that have been received on this interface and which were discarded because there was no matching cross- connect entry. This object MUST count on a per- interface basis regardless of which label space the interface participates in.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfOutLabelsInUse,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of top-most labels in the outgoing label stacks that are in use at this point in time on this interface. This object MUST count on a per-interface basis regardless of which label space the interface participates in.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfOutFragmentedPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of outgoing MPLS packets that required fragmentation before transmission on this interface. This object MUST count on a per-interface basis regardless of which label space the interface participates in.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentIndexNext,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the next available value to be used for mplsInSegmentIndex when creating entries in the mplsInSegmentTable. The special value of a string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that no new entries can be created in this table. Agents not allowing managers to create entries in this table MUST set this object to this special value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains a description of the incoming MPLS segments (labels) to an LSR and their associated parameters. The index for this table is mplsInSegmentIndex. The index structure of this table is specifically designed to handle many different MPLS implementations that manage their labels both in a distributed and centralized manner. The table is also designed to handle existing MPLS labels as defined in RFC3031 as well as longer ones that may be necessary in the future. In cases where the label cannot fit into the mplsInSegmentLabel object, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr will indicate this by being set to the first accessible column in the appropriate extension table's row. In this case an additional table MUST be provided and MUST be indexed by at least the indexes used by this table. In all other cases when the label is represented within the mplsInSegmentLabel object, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr MUST be set to 0.0. Due to the fact that MPLS labels may not exceed 24 bits, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr object is only a provision for future-proofing the MIB module. Thus, the definition of any extension tables is beyond the scope of this MIB module.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentEntry,,not-accessible,mplsInSegmentIndex,current,,An entry in this table represents one incoming segment as is represented in an LSR's LFIB. An entry can be created by a network administrator or an SNMP agent, or an MPLS signaling protocol. The creator of the entry is denoted by mplsInSegmentOwner. The value of mplsInSegmentRowStatus cannot be active(1) unless the ifTable entry corresponding to mplsInSegmentInterface exists. An entry in this table must match any incoming packets, and indicates an instance of mplsXCEntry based on which forwarding and/or switching actions are taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this in-segment. The string containing the single octet 0x00 MUST not be used as an index.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentInterface,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This object represents the interface index for the incoming MPLS interface. A value of zero represents all interfaces participating in the per-platform label space. This may only be used in cases where the incoming interface and label are associated with the same mplsXCEntry. Specifically, given a label and any incoming interface pair from the per-platform label space, the outgoing label/interface mapping remains the same. If this is not the case, then individual entries MUST exist that can then be mapped to unique mplsXCEntries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentLabel,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,If the corresponding instance of mplsInSegmentLabelPtr is zeroDotZero then this object MUST contain the incoming label associated with this in-segment. If not this object SHOULD be zero and MUST be ignored.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentLabelPtr,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,If the label for this segment cannot be represented fully within the mplsInSegmentLabel object, this object MUST point to the first accessible column of a conceptual row in an external table containing the label. In this case, the mplsInSegmentTopLabel object SHOULD be set to 0 and ignored. This object MUST be set to zeroDotZero otherwise.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentNPop,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of labels to pop from the incoming packet. Normally only the top label is popped from the packet and used for all switching decisions for that packet. This is indicated by setting this object to the default value of 1. If an LSR supports popping of more than one label, this object MUST be set to that number. This object cannot be modified if mplsInSegmentRowStatus is active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentAddrFamily,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(0):ipV4(1):ipV6(2):nsap(3):hdlc(4):bbn1822(5):all802(6):e163(7):e164(8):f69(9):x121(10):ipx(11):appleTalk(12):decnetIV(13):banyanVines(14):e164withNsap(15):dns(16):distinguishedName(17):asNumber(18):xtpOverIpv4(19):xtpOverIpv6(20):xtpNativeModeXTP(21):fibreChannelWWPN(22):fibreChannelWWNN(23):gwid(24):afi(25):mplsTpSectionEndpointIdentifier(26):mplsTpLspEndpointIdentifier(27):mplsTpPseudowireEndpointIdentifier(28):eigrpCommonServiceFamily(16384):eigrpIpv4ServiceFamily(16385):eigrpIpv6ServiceFamily(16386):lispCanonicalAddressFormat(16387):bgpLs(16388):fortyeightBitMac(16389):sixtyfourBitMac(16390):oui(16391):mac24(16392):mac40(16393):ipv664(16394):rBridgePortID(16395):trillNickname(16396):reserved(65535),The IANA address family [IANAFamily] of packets received on this segment, which is used at an egress LSR to deliver them to the appropriate layer 3 entity. A value of other(0) indicates that the family type is either unknown or undefined; this SHOULD NOT be used at an egress LSR. This object cannot be modified if mplsInSegmentRowStatus is active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentXCIndex,OCTET,read-only,,current,,Index into mplsXCTable which identifies which cross- connect entry this segment is part of. The string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that this entry is not referred to by any cross-connect entry. When a cross-connect entry is created which this in-segment is a part of, this object is automatically updated to reflect the value of mplsXCIndex of that cross-connect entry.

This value may point at an entry in the mplsTunnelResourceTable in the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB (RFC3812) to indicate which traffic parameter settings for this segment if it represents an LSP used for a TE tunnel. This value may optionally point at an externally defined traffic parameter specification table. A value of zeroDotZero indicates best-effort treatment. By having the same value of this object, two or more segments can indicate resource sharing of such things as LSP queue space, etc. This object cannot be modified if mplsInSegmentRowStatus is active(1). For entries in this table that are preserved after a re-boot, the agent MUST ensure that their integrity be preserved, or this object should be set to 0.0 if it cannot.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.10,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This variable is used to create, modify, and/or delete a row in this table. When a row in this table has a row in the active(1) state, no objects in this row can be modified except the mplsInSegmentRowStatus and mplsInSegmentStorageType.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.11,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),This variable indicates the storage type for this object. The agent MUST ensure that this object's value remains consistent with the associated mplsXCEntry. Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write-access to any columnar objects in the row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains statistical information for incoming MPLS segments to an LSR.

The counters in this entry should behave in a manner similar to that of the interface. mplsInSegmentPerfDiscontinuityTime indicates the time of the last discontinuity in all of these objects.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This value represents the total number of octets received by this segment. It MUST be equal to the least significant 32 bits of mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets if mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets is supported according to the rules spelled out in RFC2863.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfPackets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,Total number of packets received by this segment.

One possible reason for discarding such a labeled packet could be to free up buffer space.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received. This is the 64 bit version of mplsInSegmentPerfOctets, if mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets is supported according to the rules spelled out in RFC2863.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this segment's Counter32 or Counter64 suffered a discontinuity. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentIndexNext,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the next available value to be used for mplsOutSegmentIndex when creating entries in the mplsOutSegmentTable. The special value of a string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that no new entries can be created in this table. Agents not allowing managers to create entries in this table MUST set this object to this special value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains a representation of the outgoing segments from an LSR.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentEntry,,not-accessible,mplsOutSegmentIndex,current,,An entry in this table represents one outgoing segment. An entry can be created by a network administrator, an SNMP agent, or an MPLS signaling protocol. The object mplsOutSegmentOwner indicates the creator of this entry. The value of mplsOutSegmentRowStatus cannot be active(1) unless the ifTable entry corresponding to mplsOutSegmentInterface exists. Note that the indexing of this table uses a single, arbitrary index (mplsOutSegmentIndex) to indicate which out-segment (i.e.: label) is being switched to from which in-segment (i.e: label) or in-segments. This is necessary because it is possible to have an equal-cost multi-path situation where two identical out-going labels are assigned to the same cross-connect (i.e.: they go to two different neighboring LSRs); thus, requiring two out-segments. In order to preserve the uniqueness of the references by the mplsXCEntry, an arbitrary integer must be used as the index for this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,This value contains a unique index for this row. While a value of a string containing the single octet 0x00 is not valid as an index for entries in this table, it can be supplied as a valid value to index the mplsXCTable to represent entries for which no out-segment has been configured or exists.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentInterface,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This value must contain the interface index of the outgoing interface. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1). The mplsOutSegmentRowStatus cannot be set to active(1) until this object is set to a value corresponding to a valid ifEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),This value indicates whether or not a top label should be pushed onto the outgoing packet's label stack. The value of this variable MUST be set to true(1) if the outgoing interface does not support pop-and-go (and no label stack remains). For example, on ATM interface, or if the segment represents a tunnel origination. Note that it is considered an error in the case that mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel is set to false, but the cross-connect entry which refers to this out-segment has a non-zero mplsLabelStackIndex. The LSR MUST ensure that this situation does not happen. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentTopLabel,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,If mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel is true then this represents the label that should be pushed onto the top of the outgoing packet's label stack. Otherwise this value SHOULD be set to 0 by the management station and MUST be ignored by the agent. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentTopLabelPtr,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,If the label for this segment cannot be represented fully within the mplsOutSegmentLabel object, this object MUST point to the first accessible column of a conceptual row in an external table containing the label. In this case, the mplsOutSegmentTopLabel object SHOULD be set to 0 and ignored. This object MUST be set to zeroDotZero otherwise.

Only values unknown(0), ipv4(1) or ipv6(2) have to be supported. A value of unknown(0) is allowed only when the outgoing interface is of type point-to-point. If any other unsupported values are attempted in a set operation, the agent MUST return an inconsistentValue error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentNextHopAddr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The internet address of the next hop. The type of this address is determined by the value of the mplslOutSegmentNextHopAddrType object. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1).

Negative values are not allowed, as they do not correspond to valid values of mplsTunnelIndex. Note that this object offers an unused value for an mplsTunnelIndex value at the ingress side of a tunnel. At other LSRs the value of mplsTunnelIndex SHOULD be taken from the value signaled by the MPLS signaling protocol. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.2,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The mplsTunnelTable allows new MPLS tunnels to be created between an LSR and a remote endpoint, and existing tunnels to be reconfigured or removed. Note that only point-to-point tunnel segments are supported, although multipoint-to-point and point- to-multipoint connections are supported by an LSR acting as a cross-connect. Each MPLS tunnel can thus have one out-segment originating at this LSR and/or one in-segment terminating at this LSR.

Whenever a new entry is created with mplsTunnelIsIf set to true(1), then a corresponding entry is created in ifTable as well (see RFC 2863). The ifType of this entry is mplsTunnel(150). A tunnel entry needs to be uniquely identified across a MPLS network. Indices mplsTunnelIndex and mplsTunnelInstance uniquely identify a tunnel on the LSR originating the tunnel. To uniquely identify a tunnel across an MPLS network requires index mplsTunnelIngressLSRId. The last index mplsTunnelEgressLSRId is useful in identifying all instances of a tunnel that terminate on the same egress LSR.

Note that if this variable is set to true then the ifName of the interface corresponding to this tunnel should have a value equal to mplsTunnelName. Also see the description of ifName in RFC 2863. This object is meaningful only at the ingress and egress LSRs.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.2.1.8,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelIfIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,If mplsTunnelIsIf is set to true, then this value contains the LSR-assigned ifIndex which corresponds to an entry in the interfaces table.

The following describes these bit fields: fastRerouteThis flag indicates that the any tunnel hop may choose to reroute this tunnel without tearing it down. This flag permits transit routers to use a local repair mechanism which may result in violation of the explicit routing of this tunnel. When a fault is detected on an adjacent downstream link or node, a transit router can re-route traffic for fast service restoration. mergingPermitted This flag permits transit routers to merge this session with other RSVP sessions for the purpose of reducing resource overhead on downstream transit routers, thereby providing better network scaling. isPersistent Indicates whether this tunnel should be restored automatically after a failure occurs. isPinned This flag indicates whether the loose- routed hops of this tunnel are to be pinned. recordRouteThis flag indicates whether or not the signalling protocol should remember the tunnel path after it has been signaled.

A group of tunnel instances is defined as a set of LSPs with the same mplsTunnelIndex in this table, but with a different mplsTunnelInstance. Tunnel instance priorities are used to denote the priority at which a particular tunnel instance will supercede another. Instances of tunnels containing the same mplsTunnelInstancePriority will be used for load sharing.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.3,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelHopListIndexNext,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This object contains an appropriate value to be used for mplsTunnelHopListIndex when creating entries in the mplsTunnelHopTable. If the number of unassigned entries is exhausted, a retrieval operation will return a value of 0. This object may also return a value of 0 when the LSR is unable to accept conceptual row creation, for example, if the mplsTunnelHopTable is implemented as read-only. To obtain the value of mplsTunnelHopListIndex for a new entry in the mplsTunnelHopTable, the manager issues a management protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value of mplsTunnelHopIndex. When the SET is performed to create a row in the mplsTunnelHopTable, the Command Responder (agent) must determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network Management Applications may attempt to create a row (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to an implementation-specific algorithm. If the value is in use, however, the SET fails. The Network Management Application must then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.4,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelHopTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The mplsTunnelHopTable is used to indicate the hops, strict or loose, for an instance of an MPLS tunnel defined in mplsTunnelTable, when it is established via signalling, for the outgoing direction of the tunnel. Thus at a transit LSR, this table contains the desired path of the tunnel from this LSR onwards. Each row in this table is indexed by mplsTunnelHopListIndex which corresponds to a group of hop lists or path options. Each row also has a secondary index mplsTunnelHopIndex, which indicates a group of hops (also known as a path option). Finally, the third index, mplsTunnelHopIndex indicates the specific hop information for a path option. In case we want to specify a particular interface on the originating LSR of an outgoing tunnel by which we want packets to exit the LSR, we specify this as the first hop for this tunnel in mplsTunnelHopTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.4.1.5,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelHopIpAddr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The Tunnel Hop Address for this tunnel hop. The type of this address is determined by the value of the corresponding mplsTunnelHopAddrType. The value of this object cannot be changed if the value of the corresponding mplsTunnelHopRowStatus object is 'active'. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.4.1.6,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelHopIpPrefixLen,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,If mplsTunnelHopAddrType is set to ipv4(1) or ipv6(2), then this value will contain an appropriate prefix length for the IP address in object mplsTunnelHopIpAddr. Otherwise this value is irrelevant and should be ignored.

This object should be used in conjunction with mplsTunnelHopIpAddress which would contain the LSR Router ID in this case. Otherwise the agent should set this object to zero-length string and the manager should ignore this.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.4.1.9,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelHopLspId,OCTET,read-create,,current,,If mplsTunnelHopAddrType is set to lspid(5), then this value will contain the LSPID of a tunnel of this hop. The present tunnel being configured is tunneled through this hop (using label stacking). This object is otherwise insignificant and should contain a value of 0 to indicate this fact.

If this value is set to 'false', then this hop must be avoided when calculating the path for this tunnel. The default value of this object is 'true', so that by default all indicated hops are included in the CSPF path computation. If this object is set to 'false' the value of mplsTunnelHopType should be ignored.

If this value is set to explicit, the user should specify the entire path for the tunnel to take. This path may contain strict or loose hops. Each hop along a specific path SHOULD have this object set to the same value
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.4.1.14,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelHopRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This variable is used to create, modify, and/or delete a row in this table.

If the number of unassigned entries is exhausted, a retrieval operation will return a value of 0. This object may also return a value of 0 when the LSR is unable to accept conceptual row creation, for example, if the mplsTunnelTable is implemented as read-only. To obtain the mplsTunnelResourceIndex value for a new entry, the manager must first issue a management protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value of this object.

Thus at a transit LSR, this table (if the table is supported and if the signaling protocol is recording actual route information) contains the actual route of the whole tunnel. If the signaling protocol is not recording the actual route, this table MAY report the information from the mplsTunnelHopTable or the mplsTunnelCHopTable. Each row in this table is indexed by mplsTunnelARHopListIndex. Each row also has a secondary index mplsTunnelARHopIndex, corresponding to the next hop that this row corresponds to. Please note that since the information necessary to build entries within this table is not provided by some MPLS signalling protocols, implementation of this table is optional. Furthermore, since the information in this table is actually provided by the MPLS signalling protocol after the path has been set-up, the entries in this table are provided only for observation, and hence, all variables in this table are accessible exclusively as read- only. Note also that the contents of this table may change while it is being read because of re-routing activities. A network administrator may verify that the actual route read is consistent by reference to the mplsTunnelLastPathChange object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.8,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelCHopTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The mplsTunnelCHopTable is used to indicate the hops, strict or loose, for an MPLS tunnel defined in mplsTunnelTable, as computed by a constraint- based routing protocol, based on the mplsTunnelHopTable for the outgoing direction of the tunnel. Thus at a transit LSR, this table (if the table is supported) MAY contain the path computed by the CSPF engine on (or on behalf of) this LSR. Each row in this table is indexed by mplsTunnelCHopListIndex. Each row also has a secondary index mplsTunnelCHopIndex, corresponding to the next hop that this row corresponds to. In case we want to specify a particular interface on the originating LSR of an outgoing tunnel by which we want packets to exit the LSR, we specify this as the first hop for this tunnel in mplsTunnelCHopTable. Please note that since the information necessary to build entries within this table may not be supported by some LSRs, implementation of this table is optional. Furthermore, since the information in this table describes the path computed by the CSPF engine the entries in this table are read-only.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.2,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityIndex,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,This index is used as a secondary index to uniquely identify this row. Before creating a row in this table, the 'mplsLdpEntityIndexNext' object should be retrieved. That value should be used for the value of this index when creating a row in this table. NOTE: if a value of zero (0) is retrieved, that indicates that no rows can be created in this table at this time. A secondary index (this object) is meaningful to some but not all, LDP implementations. For example an LDP implementation which uses PPP would use this index to differentiate PPP sub-links. Another way to use this index is to give this the value of ifIndex. However, this is dependant on the implementation.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.3,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The version number of the LDP protocol which will be used in the session initialization message. Section 3.5.3 in the LDP Specification specifies that the version of the LDP protocol is negotiated during session establishment. The value of this object represents the value that is sent in the initialization message.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.4,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,enable(1):disable(2),The administrative status of this LDP Entity. If this object is changed from 'enable' to 'disable' and this entity has already attempted to establish contact with a Peer, then all contact with that Peer is lost and all information from that Peer needs to be removed from the MIB. (This implies that the network management subsystem should clean up any related entry in the mplsLdpPeerTable. This further implies that a 'tear-down' for that session is issued and the session and all information related to that session cease to exist). At this point the operator is able to change values which are related to this entity. When the admin status is set back to 'enable', then this Entity will attempt to establish a new session with the Peer.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.5,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(1):enabled(2):disabled(3),The operational status of this LDP Entity. The value of unknown(1) indicates that the operational status cannot be determined at this time. The value of unknown should be a transient condition before changing to enabled(2) or disabled(3).

According to the LDP Specification [RFC3036] a value of 255 or less specifies the default maximum length of 4096 octets, this is why the value of this object starts at 256. The operator should explicitly choose the default value (i.e., 4096), or some other value. The receiving LSR MUST calculate the maximum PDU length for the session by using the smaller of its and its peer's proposals for Max PDU Length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.9,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The 16-bit integer value which is the proposed keep alive hold timer for this LDP Entity.

The Hello Hold time in seconds. An LSR maintains a record of Hellos received from potential peers. This object represents the Hold Time in the Common Hello Parameters TLV of the Hello Message. A value of 0 is a default value and should be interpretted in conjunction with the mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object. If the value of this object is 0: if the value of the mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object is false(2), then this specifies that the Hold Time's actual default value is 15 seconds (i.e., the default Hold time for Link Hellos is 15 seconds). Otherwise if the value of the mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object is true(1), then this specifies that the Hold Time's actual default value is 45 seconds (i.e., the default Hold time for Targeted Hellos is 45 seconds). A value of 65535 means infinite (i.e., wait forever). All other values represent the amount of time in seconds to wait for a Hello Message. Setting the hold time to a value smaller than 15 is not recommended, although not forbidden according to RFC3036.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.11,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityInitSessionThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When attempting to establish a session with a given Peer, the given LDP Entity should send out the SNMP notification, 'mplsLdpInitSessionThresholdExceeded', when the number of Session Initialization messages sent exceeds this threshold. The notification is used to notify an operator when this Entity and its Peer are possibly engaged in an endless sequence of messages as each NAKs the other's Initialization messages with Error Notification messages. Setting this threshold which triggers the notification is one way to notify the operator. The notification should be generated each time this threshold is exceeded and for every subsequent Initialization message which is NAK'd with an Error Notification message after this threshold is exceeded. A value of 0 (zero) for this object indicates that the threshold is infinity, thus the SNMP notification will never be generated.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.12,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityLabelDistMethod,INTEGER,read-create,,current,downstreamOnDemand(1):downstreamUnsolicited(2),For any given LDP session, the method of label distribution must be specified.

If the value of this object is conservative(1) then advertized label mappings are retained only if they will be used to forward packets, i.e., if label came from a valid next hop. If the value of this object is liberal(2) then all advertized label mappings are retained whether they are from a valid next hop or not.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.14,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit,Integer32,read-create,,current,,If the value of this object is 0 (zero) then Loop Detection for Path Vectors is disabled. Otherwise, if this object has a value greater than zero, then Loop Dection for Path Vectors is enabled, and the Path Vector Limit is this value. Also, the value of the object, 'mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable', must be set to either 'pathVector(4)' or 'hopCountAndPathVector(5)', if this object has a value greater than 0 (zero), otherwise it is ignored.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.15,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityHopCountLimit,Integer32,read-create,,current,,If the value of this object is 0 (zero), then Loop Detection using Hop Counters is disabled. If the value of this object is greater than 0 (zero) then Loop Detection using Hop Counters is enabled, and this object specifies this Entity's maximum allowable value for the Hop Count. Also, the value of the object mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable must be set to either 'hopCount(3)' or 'hopCountAndPathVector(5)' if this object has a value greater than 0 (zero), otherwise it is ignored.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.16,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityTransportAddrKind,INTEGER,read-create,,current,interface(1):loopback(2),This specifies whether the loopback or interface address is to be used as the transport address in the transport address TLV of the hello message. If the value is interface(1), then the IP address of the interface from which hello messages are sent is used as the transport address in the hello message. Otherwise, if the value is loopback(2), then the IP address of the loopback interface is used as the transport address in the hello message.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.4.1.2.3.1.17,MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB::mplsLdpEntityTargetPeer,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),If this LDP entity uses targeted peer then set this to true.

If the value of this object is 'active(1)', then none of the writable objects of this entry can be modified. The Agent should delete this row when the session ceases to exist. If an operator wants to associate the session with a different FEC, the recommended procedure is (as described in detail in the section entitled, 'Changing Values After Session Establishment', and again described in theclause of the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus object) is to set the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to down, thereby explicitly causing a session to be torn down. This will also cause this entry to be deleted. Then, set the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to enable which enables a new session to be initiated.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherStatsFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of history control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::historyControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this historyControl entry. Each instance of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry will be deleted by the agent if this historyControlEntry is not equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,etherHistoryIndex:etherHistorySampleIndex,current,,An historical sample of Ethernet statistics on a particular Ethernet interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The history of which this entry is a part. The history identified by a particular value of this index is the same history as identified by the same value of historyControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets (including bad packets) received during this sampling interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.4.1.2,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingPHistorySampleIndex,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.4.1.3,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingPHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.4.1.4,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingPHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.4.1.5,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingPHistoryDataOctets,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of octets of data in good frames received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) in non-MAC packets during this sampling interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::historyControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3,RMON-MIB::alarm,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hostControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up the discovery of hosts on a particular interface and the collection of statistics about these hosts. For example, an instance of the hostControlTableSize object might be named hostControlTableSize.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostControlLastDeleteTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last entry was deleted from the portion of the hostTable associated with this hostControlEntry. If no deletions have occurred, this value shall be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this hostControl entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated entries in the hostTable, hostTimeTable, and the hostTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2,RMON-MIB::hostTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of host entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1,RMON-MIB::hostEntry,,not-accessible,hostIndex:hostAddress,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular host that has been discovered on an interface of this device. For example, an instance of the hostOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostOutBroadcastPkts.1.6.8.0.32.27.3.176
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that defines the relative ordering of the creation time of hosts captured for a particular hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostInPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostOutPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, including bad packets, transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), except for those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::hostOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), including those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::hostOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of bad packets transmitted by this address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::hostOutBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to the broadcast address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::hostOutMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to a multicast address since this host was added to the hostTable. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostTimeAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTimeCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostTime table among those entries associated with the same hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostTimeIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hostControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hostControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTopNHostIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The host table for which a top N report will be prepared on behalf of this entry. The host table identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the same host table as identified by the same value of hostIndex. This object may not be modified if the associated hostTopNStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostTopNRateBase,INTEGER,read-create,,current,hostTopNInPkts(1):hostTopNOutPkts(2):hostTopNInOctets(3):hostTopNOutOctets(4):hostTopNOutErrors(5):hostTopNOutBroadcastPkts(6):hostTopNOutMulticastPkts(7),The variable for each host that the hostTopNRate variable is based upon.

The new value is used as the requested duration of this report, which is loaded into the associated hostTopNDuration object. When this object is set to a non-zero value, any associated hostTopNEntries shall be made inaccessible by the monitor.

The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the filter table. Each such entry defines one filter that is to be applied to every packet received on an interface.

The filters identified by a particular value of this object are associated with the same channel as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset from the beginning of each packet where a match of packet data will be attempted. This offset is measured from the point in the physical layer packet after the framing bits, if any. For example, in an Ethernet frame, this point is at the beginning of the destination MAC address. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::channelIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the channel table. Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::channelIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the interface on this remote network monitoring device to which the associated filters are applied to allow data into this channel. The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirDataLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with performs the following operations on every packet: 1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by this object, discard the packet and exit (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified protocol). 2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by that object, discard the packet and exit. 3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the filterOffset value to move further into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with will discard the packet if the packet doesn't match this protocol directory entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8,RMON-MIB::capture,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of buffers control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,current,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters. As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCapturedPackets,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets currently in this captureBuffer.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTurnOnTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this capture buffer was first turned on.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::bufferControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::bufferControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this buffer Control Entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the captureBuffer table associated with a particular bufferControlEntry. This index will start at 1 and increase by one for each new packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex. Should this value reach 2147483647, the next packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex shall cause this value to wrap around to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketTime,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of milliseconds that had passed since this capture buffer was first turned on when this packet was captured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::eventLastTimeSent,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this event entry last generated an event. If this entry has not generated any events, this value will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::eventOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it. If this object contains a string starting with 'monitor' and has associated entries in the log table, all connected management stations should retrieve those log entries, as they may have significance to all management stations connected to this device

These indexes are assigned beginning with 1 and increase by one with each new log entry. The association between values of logIndex and logEntries is fixed for the lifetime of each logEntry. The agent may choose to delete the oldest instances of logEntry as required because of lack of memory. It is an implementation-specific matter as to when this deletion may occur.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated nlHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

This table is indexed first by the source address and then by the destination address to make it convenient to collect all conversations from a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all pairs of addresses seen in all packets with no MAC errors and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors. Further, this table will only contain entries that have a corresponding entry in the nlMatrixDSTable with the same source address and destination address.

The nlMatrix[SD/DS] table is identified by the value of the hlMatrixControlIndex for that table - that value is used here to identify the particular table. This object may not be modified if the associated nlMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).

This object may not be modified if the associated nlMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1). If this value is less than or equal to 2, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNTable associated with this object. If this value is greater than or equal to 3, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNHighCapacityTable associated with this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the nlMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate or nlMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.10,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries.

(Note that the corresponding nlMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to nlMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to nlMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on nlMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.

The first protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the network-layer protocol of the alMatrixDSSourceAddress and alMatrixDSDestAddress. The nlMatrixDSDestAddress value in the index identifies the network-layer address of the destination host in this conversation. The nlMatrixDSSourceAddress value in the index identifies the network-layer address of the source host in this conversation. The second protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the protocol that is counted by this entry. An example of the indexing of this entry is alMatrixDSPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.7.4.128.2.6.6.34. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixDSTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixDSPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type without errors transmitted from the source address to the destination address since this entry was added to the alMatrixDSTable. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixDSOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type transmitted from the source address to the destination address since this entry was added to the alMatrixDSTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), excluding octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixDSCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the entry has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters that control the creation of a report of the top N matrix entries according to a selected metric.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlEntry,,not-accessible,alMatrixTopNControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the alMatrixTopNControlTable. An example of the indexing of this table is alMatrixTopNControlDuration.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alMatrixTopNControlTable. Each such entry defines one topN report prepared for one interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlMatrixIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The alMatrix[SD/DS] table for which a topN report will be prepared on behalf of this entry. The alMatrix[SD/DS] table is identified by the value of the hlMatrixControlIndex for that table - that value is used here to identify the particular table. This object may not be modified if the associated alMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlRateBase,INTEGER,read-create,,current,alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts(1):alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets(2):alMatrixTopNAllPkts(3):alMatrixTopNAllOctets(4):alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts(5):alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets(6):alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts(7):alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets(8),This object controls which alMatrix[SD/DS] entry that the alMatrixTopNEntries are sorted by, which view of the matrix table that will be used, as well as which table the results will be reported in. The values alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts, alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets, alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets cause collection only from protocols that have no child protocols that are counted. The values alMatrixTopNAllPkts, alMatrixTopNAllOctets, alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets cause collection from all alMatrix entries. This object may not be modified if the associated alMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated alMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the alMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the alMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGeneratedReports,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of reports that have been generated by this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.6,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this alMatrixTopNControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries requested for this report. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set alMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of alMatrixTopNPktRate or alMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.10,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the alMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A set of statistics for those application-layer matrix entries that have counted the highest number of octets or packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNEntry,,not-accessible,alMatrixTopNControlIndex:alMatrixTopNIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the alMatrixTopNTable. The alMatrixTopNControlIndex value in the index identifies the alMatrixTopNControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. An example of the indexing of this table is alMatrixTopNPktRate.3.10
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alMatrixTopNTable among those in the same report. This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The protocolDirLocalIndex of the network-layer protocol of this entry's network address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNSourceAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the source host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNDestAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the destination host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNAppProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The type of the protocol counted by this matrix entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.6,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNPktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDPkts object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReversePktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSPkts object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDOctets object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReverseOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSOctets object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDOctets object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNOctetRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18,RMON2-MIB::usrHistory,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a group of user-defined MIB objects to be sampled periodically (called a bucket-group). For example, an instance of usrHistoryControlInterval might be named usrHistoryControlInterval.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlObjects,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of MIB objects to be collected in the portion of usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. This object may not be modified if the associated instance of usrHistoryControlStatus is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.7,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this variable history control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the usrHistoryTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A list of MIB instances to be sampled periodically. Entries in this table are created when an associated usrHistoryControlObjects object is created. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index is that of the associated usrHistoryControlEntry. For example, an instance of usrHistoryObjectVariable might be usrHistoryObjectVariable.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19,RMON2-MIB::probeConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.1,RMON2-MIB::probeCapabilities,BITS,read-only,,current,etherStats(0):historyControl(1):etherHistory(2):alarm(3):hosts(4):hostTopN(5):matrix(6):filter(7):capture(8):event(9):tokenRingMLStats(10):tokenRingPStats(11):tokenRingMLHistory(12):tokenRingPHistory(13):ringStation(14):ringStationOrder(15):ringStationConfig(16):sourceRouting(17):protocolDirectory(18):protocolDistribution(19):addressMapping(20):nlHost(21):nlMatrix(22):alHost(23):alMatrix(24):usrHistory(25):probeConfig(26),An indication of the RMON MIB groups supported on at least one interface by this probe.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB.

This table is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least-significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.6.1,P-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpPortOverflowEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dTpPort,current,,The most significant bits of statistics counters for a high- capacity interface of a transparent bridge.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

Changes to a bit in this object affect the per-port, per-VLAN Registrar control for Registration Fixed for the relevant GVRP state machine on each port. A port may not be added in this set if it is already a member of the set of ports in dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts. The default value of this object is a string of zeros of appropriate length, indicating not fixed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.4.3.1.3,Q-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The set of ports that are prohibited by management from being included in the egress list for this VLAN. Changes to this object that cause a port to be included or excluded affect the per-port, per-VLAN Registrar control for Registration Forbidden for the relevant GVRP state machine on each port.

This will report values >=4096 if a new Local VLAN may be created or else the value 0 if this is not possible. A row creation operation in this table for an entry with a local VlanIndex value may fail if the current value of this object is not used as the index. Even if the value read is used, there is no guarantee that it will still be the valid index when the create operation is attempted; another manager may have already got in during the intervening time interval. In this case, dot1qNextFreeLocalVlanIndex should be re-read and the creation re-tried with the new value. This value will automatically change when the current value is used to create a new row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.4.5,Q-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1qPortVlanTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table containing per-port control and status information for VLAN configuration in the device.

When admitAll(1), untagged frames or Priority-Tagged frames received on this port will be accepted and assigned to a VID based on the PVID and VID Set for this port. This control does not affect VLAN-independent Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) frames, such as GVRP and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). It does affect VLAN- dependent BPDU frames, such as GMRP. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.4.5.1.3,Q-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1qPortIngressFiltering,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),When this is true(1), the device will discard incoming frames for VLANs that do not include this Port in its Member set. When false(2), the port will accept all incoming frames. This control does not affect VLAN-independent BPDU frames, such as GVRP and STP. It does affect VLAN- dependent BPDU frames, such as GMRP. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.

The value enabled(1) indicates that GVRP is enabled on this port, as long as dot1qGvrpStatus is also enabled for this device. When disabled(2) but dot1qGvrpStatus is still enabled for the device, GVRP is disabled on this port: any GVRP packets received will be silently discarded, and no GVRP registrations will be propagated from other ports. This object affects all GVRP Applicant and Registrar state machines on this port. A transition from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will cause a reset of all GVRP state machines on this port. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each logical area of storage that is allocated and has fixed resource limits. The amount of storage represented in an entity is the amount actually usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to formatting or file system reference information. These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system. Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table. Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space'). This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures.

The value of this object should be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's `console'. This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it. If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTableLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.37.1.6.1,ATM-MIB::atmVplEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:atmVplVpi,current,,An entry in the VPL table. This entry is used to model a bi-directional VPL. To create a VPL at an ATM interface, either of the following procedures are used: Negotiated VPL establishment (1) The management application creates a VPL entry in the atmVplTable by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5). This may fail for the following reasons: - The selected VPI value is unavailable, - The selected VPI value is in use. Otherwise, the agent creates a row and reserves the VPI value on that port. (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable, thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent ATM traffic parameters and the service category for receive and transmit directions of the VPL. (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists, the manager must create a new row(s) in that table. (2b) The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic parameters through setting the atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values in the VPL table, which point to the rows containing desired ATM traffic parameter values in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable. The agent will check the availability of resources and may refuse the request. If the transmit and receive service categories are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the request. (3) The manager activates the VPL by setting the the atmVplRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources to satisfy the requested traffic parameter values and the service category for that VPL. (4) If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host or switch, the manager turns on the atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL traffic flow on. Otherwise, the atmVpCrossConnectTable must be used to cross-connect the VPL to another VPL(s) in an ATM switch or network. One-Shot VPL Establishment A VPL may also be established in one step by a set-request with all necessary VPL parameter values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one-shot VPL establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step-wise error checking. VPL Retirement A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6), and the agent may release all associated resources.

To create a VCL at an ATM interface, either of the following procedures are used: Negotiated VCL establishment (1) The management application creates a VCL entry in the atmVclTable by setting atmVclRowStatus to createAndWait(5). This may fail for the following reasons: - The selected VPI/VCI values are unavailable, - The selected VPI/VCI values are in use. Otherwise, the agent creates a row and reserves the VPI/VCI values on that port. (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable, thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent ATM traffic parameters and the service category for receive and transmit directions of the VCL.

The value 0 indicates that no unassigned entries are available. To obtain the atmVpCrossConnectIndex value for a new entry, the manager issues a management protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value of this object.

This entry is used to model a bi-directional ATM VP cross-connect which cross-connects two VPLs. Step-wise Procedures to set up a VP Cross-connect Once the entries in the atmVplTable are created, the following procedures are used to cross-connect the VPLs together. (1) The manager obtains a unique atmVpCrossConnectIndex by reading the atmVpCrossConnectIndexNext object. (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the ATM VP Cross Connect Table, one for each cross-connection between two VPLs. Each row is indexed by the ATM interface port numbers and VPI values of the two ends of that cross-connection. This set of rows specifies the topology of the VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex. Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to createAndWait(5). The agent checks the requested topology and the mutual sanity of the ATM traffic parameters and service categories, i.e., the row creation fails if: - the requested topology is incompatible with associated values of atmVplCastType, - the requested topology is not supported by the agent, - the traffic/service category parameter values associated with the requested row are incompatible with those of already existing rows for this VP cross-connect. [For example, for setting up a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect must equal to the traffic parameters in the transmit direction of the other VPL at the high end of the cross-connect, otherwise, the row creation fails.] The agent also checks for internal errors in building the cross-connect. The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled in by the agent at this point. (2b) The manager promotes the row in the atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources specified by the ATM traffic parameter and Service category values for each direction of the VP cross-connect in an ATM switch or network. (3) The manager sets the atmVpCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all rows of this VP cross-connect to turn the traffic flow on. One-Shot VP Cross-Connect Establishment A VP cross-connect may also be established in one step by a set-request with all necessary parameter values and atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). In contrast to the negotiated VP cross-connect establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one-shot VP cross-connect establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step-wise error checking. VP Cross-Connect Retirement A VP cross-connect identified by a particular value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex is released by: (1) Setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus of all rows identified by this value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6). The agent may release all associated resources, and the atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVplTable row are removed. Note that a situation when only a subset of the associated rows are delete

IPv6 routers forward datagrams. IPv6 hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `wrongValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipv6IpForwarding.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.2,IPV6-MIB::ipv6DefaultHopLimit,INTEGER,read-write,,obsolete,,The default value inserted into the Hop Limit field of the IPv6 header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a Hop Limit value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

If the number of entries has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceTableLastChange.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfTable,,not-accessible,,obsolete,,The IPv6 Interfaces table contains information on the entity's internetwork-layer interfaces. An IPv6 interface constitutes a logical network layer attachment to the layer immediately below IPv6 including internet layer 'tunnels', such as tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 itself. This table is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfEntry,,not-accessible,ipv6IfIndex,obsolete,,An interface entry containing objects about a particular IPv6 interface. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.1,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,obsolete,,A unique non-zero value identifying the particular IPv6 interface. This object is obsoleted. In the IP-MIB, interfaces are simply identified by IfIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.2,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfDescr,OCTET,read-write,,obsolete,,A textual string containing information about the interface. This string may be set by the network management system. This object is obsoleted by IF-MIB::ifDescr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.3,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfLowerLayer,OBJECT,read-only,,obsolete,,This object identifies the protocol layer over which this network interface operates. If this network interface operates over the data-link layer, then the value of this object refers to an instance of ifIndex [RFC1573]. If this network interface operates over an IPv4 interface, the value of this object refers to an instance of ipAdEntAddr [RFC1213]. If this network interface operates over another IPv6 interface, the value of this object refers to an instance of ipv6IfIndex. If this network interface is not currently operating over an active protocol layer, then the value of this object should be set to the OBJECT ID { 0 0 }. This object is obsolete. The IF-STACK-TABLE may be used to express relationships between interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.4,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfEffectiveMtu,Unsigned32,read-only,,obsolete,,The size of the largest IPv6 packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets.

The Interface Identifier is combined with an address prefix to form an interface address. By default, the Interface Identifier is autoconfigured according to the rules of the link type this interface is attached to. This object is obsoleted by IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceIdentifier.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.7,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfIdentifierLength,INTEGER,read-write,,obsolete,,The length of the Interface Identifier in bits. This object is obsolete. It can be derived from the length of IP-MIB::ipv6InterfaceIdentifier; Interface Identifiers that are not an even number of octets are not supported.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.8,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,obsolete,,The interface's physical address. For example, for an IPv6 interface attached to an 802.x link, this object normally contains a MAC address. Note that in some cases this address may differ from the address of the interface's protocol sub-layer. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length. This object is obsoleted by IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.9,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,obsolete,up(1):down(2),The desired state of the interface. When a managed system initializes, all IPv6 interfaces start with ipv6IfAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ipv6IfAdminStatus is then changed to the up(1) state (or remains in the down(2) state). This object is obsolete. IPv6 does not have a separate admin status; the admin status of the interface is represented by IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.10,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,obsolete,up(1):down(2):noIfIdentifier(3):unknown(4):notPresent(5),The current operational state of the interface. The noIfIdentifier(3) state indicates that no valid Interface Identifier is assigned to the interface. This state usually indicates that the link-local interface address failed Duplicate Address Detection. If ipv6IfAdminStatus is down(2) then ipv6IfOperStatus should be down(2). If ipv6IfAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ipv6IfOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should remain in the down(2) or noIfIdentifier(3) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(5) state if the interface has missing (typically, lower layer) components. This object is obsolete. IPv6 does not have a separate operational status; the operational status of the interface is represented by IF-MIB::ifOperStatus.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.55.1.5.1.11,IPV6-MIB::ipv6IfLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,obsolete,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value. This object is obsolete.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.0.2,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingTestFailed,,,,,,Generated when a ping test is determined to have failed, when the corresponding pingCtlTrapGeneration object is set to testFailure(1). In this instance, pingCtlTrapTestFailureFilter should specify the number of probes in a test required to have failed in order to consider the test failed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.0.3,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingTestCompleted,,,,,,Generated at the completion of a ping test when the corresponding pingCtlTrapGeneration object has the testCompletion(2) bit set.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingMaxConcurrentRequests,Unsigned32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of concurrent active ping requests that are allowed within an agent implementation. A value of 0 for this object implies that there is no limit for the number of concurrent active requests in effect. The limit applies only to new requests being activated. When a new value is set, the agent will continue processing all the requests already active, even if their number exceeds the limit just imposed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Defines the ping Control Table for providing, via SNMP, the capability of performing ping operations at a remote host. The results of these operations are stored in the pingResultsTable and the pingProbeHistoryTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlEntry,,not-accessible,pingCtlOwnerIndex:pingCtlTestName,current,,Defines an entry in the pingCtlTable. The first index element, pingCtlOwnerIndex, is of type SnmpAdminString, a textual convention that allows for use of the SNMPv3 View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 3415, VACM) and that allows a management application to identify its entries. The second index, pingCtlTestName (also an SnmpAdminString), enables the same management application to have multiple outstanding requests.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlOwnerIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which multiple users may need to create or modify entries independently, the initial index is used as an 'owner index'. Such an initial index has a syntax of SnmpAdminString and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName or groupName defined in VACM, in accordance with a security policy. When used in conjunction with such a security policy, all entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or group) will have the same value for this initial index. For a given user's entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the column subidentifier. More elaborate configurations are possible.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.2,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTestName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The name of the ping test. This is locally unique, within the scope of a pingCtlOwnerIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.3,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTargetAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),Specifies the type of host address to be used at a remote host for performing a ping operation.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.4,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTargetAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,Specifies the host address to be used at a remote host for performing a ping operation. The host address type is determined by the value of the corresponding pingCtlTargetAddressType. A value for this object MUST be set prior to transitioning its corresponding pingCtlEntry to active(1) via pingCtlRowStatus.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.5,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlDataSize,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,Specifies the size of the data portion to be transmitted in a ping operation, in octets. Whether this value can be applied depends on the selected implementation method for performing a ping operation, indicated by pingCtlType in the same conceptual row. If the method used allows applying the value contained in this object, then it MUST be applied. If the specified size is not appropriate for the chosen ping method, the implementation SHOULD use whatever size (appropriate to the method) is closest to the specified size. The maximum value for this object was computed by subtracting the smallest possible IP header size of 20 octets (IPv4 header with no options) and the UDP header size of 8 octets from the maximum IP packet size. An IP packet has a maximum size of 65535 octets (excluding IPv6 Jumbograms).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.6,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTimeOut,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,Specifies the time-out value, in seconds, for a remote ping operation.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.8,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Reflects the desired state that a pingCtlEntry should be in: enabled(1) - Attempt to activate the test as defined by this pingCtlEntry. disabled(2) - Deactivate the test as defined by this pingCtlEntry. Refer to the corresponding pingResultsOperStatus to determine the operational state of the test defined by this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.9,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlDataFill,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The content of this object is used together with the corresponding pingCtlDataSize value to determine how to fill the data portion of a probe packet. The option of selecting a data fill pattern can be useful when links are compressed or have data pattern sensitivities. The contents of pingCtlDataFill should be repeated in a ping packet when the size of the data portion of the ping packet is greater than the size of pingCtlDataFill.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.10,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlFrequency,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds to wait before repeating a ping test as defined by the value of the various objects in the corresponding row. A single ping test consists of a series of ping probes. The number of probes is determined by the value of the corresponding pingCtlProbeCount object. After a single test is completed the number of seconds as defined by the value of pingCtlFrequency MUST elapse before the next ping test is started. A value of 0 for this object implies that the test as defined by the corresponding entry will not be repeated.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.11,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlMaxRows,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of corresponding entries allowed in the pingProbeHistoryTable. An implementation of this MIB will remove the oldest corresponding entry in the pingProbeHistoryTable to allow the addition of an new entry once the number of corresponding rows in the pingProbeHistoryTable reaches this value. Old entries are not removed when a new test is started. Entries are added to the pingProbeHistoryTable until pingCtlMaxRows is reached before entries begin to be removed. A value of 0 for this object disables creation of pingProbeHistoryTable entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.12,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row. Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write-access to any columnar objects in the row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.13,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTrapGeneration,BITS,read-create,,current,probeFailure(0):testFailure(1):testCompletion(2),The value of this object determines when and whether to generate a notification for this entry: probeFailure(0) - Generate a pingProbeFailed notification subject to the value of pingCtlTrapProbeFailureFilter. The object pingCtlTrapProbeFailureFilter can be used to specify the number of consecutive probe failures that are required before a pingProbeFailed notification can be generated. testFailure(1) - Generate a pingTestFailed notification. In this instance the object pingCtlTrapTestFailureFilter can be used to determine the number of probe failures that signal when a test fails. testCompletion(2) - Generate a pingTestCompleted notification. By default, no bits are set, indicating that none of the above options is selected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.14,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTrapProbeFailureFilter,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object is used to determine when to generate a pingProbeFailed NOTIFICATION. Setting BIT probeFailure(0) of object pingCtlTrapGeneration to '1' implies that a pingProbeFailed NOTIFICATION is generated only when a number of consecutive ping probes equal to the value of pingCtlTrapProbeFailureFilter fail within a given ping test. After triggering the notification, the probe failure counter is reset to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.15,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlTrapTestFailureFilter,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object is used to determine when to generate a pingTestFailed NOTIFICATION. Setting BIT testFailure(1) of object pingCtlTrapGeneration to '1' implies that a pingTestFailed NOTIFICATION is generated only when a number of consecutive ping tests equal to the value of pingCtlTrapProbeFailureFilter fail. After triggering the notification, the test failure counter is reset to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.16,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlType,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The value of this object is used either to report or to select the implementation method to be used for calculating a ping response time. The value of this object MAY be selected from pingImplementationTypeDomains. Additional implementation types SHOULD be allocated as required by implementers of the DISMAN-PING-MIB under their enterprise-specific registration point and not beneath pingImplementationTypeDomains.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.17,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The purpose of this object is to provide a descriptive name of the remote ping test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.18,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlSourceAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),Specifies the type of the source address, pingCtlSourceAddress, to be used at a remote host when a ping operation is performed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.19,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlSourceAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,Use the specified IP address (which must be given in numeric form, not as a hostname) as the source address in outgoing probe packets. On hosts with more than one IP address, this option can be used to select the address to be used. If the IP address is not one of this machine's interface addresses, an error is returned and nothing is sent. A zero-length octet string value for this object disables source address specification. The address type (InetAddressType) that relates to this object is specified by the corresponding value of pingCtlSourceAddressType.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.20,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,Setting this object to an interface's ifIndex prior to starting a remote ping operation directs the ping probes to be transmitted over the specified interface. A value of zero for this object means that this option is not enabled.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.21,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlByPassRouteTable,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),The purpose of this object is to enable optional bypassing the route table. If enabled, the remote host will bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network. If the host is not on a directly attached network, an error is returned. This option can be used to perform the ping operation to a local host through an interface that has no route defined (e.g., after the interface was dropped by the routing daemon at the host).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.22,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlDSField,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,Specifies the value to store in the Type of Service (TOS) octet in the IPv4 header or in the Traffic Class octet in the IPv6 header, respectively, of the IP packet used to encapsulate the ping probe. The octet to be set in the IP header contains the Differentiated Services (DS) Field in the six most significant bits. This option can be used to determine what effect an explicit DS Field setting has on a ping response. Not all values are legal or meaningful. A value of 0 means that the function represented by this option is not supported. DS Field usage is often not supported by IP implementations, and not all values are supported. Refer to RFC 2474 and RFC 3260 for guidance on usage of this field.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.23,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This object allows entries to be created and deleted in the pingCtlTable. Deletion of an entry in this table results in the deletion of all corresponding (same pingCtlOwnerIndex and pingCtlTestName index values) pingResultsTable and pingProbeHistoryTable entries. A value MUST be specified for pingCtlTargetAddress prior to acceptance of a transition to active(1) state. When a value for pingCtlTargetAddress is set, the value of object pingCtlRowStatus changes from notReady(3) to notInService(2). Activation of a remote ping operation is controlled via pingCtlAdminStatus, not by changing this object's value to active(1). Transitions in and out of active(1) state are not allowed while an entry's pingResultsOperStatus is active(1), with the exception that deletion of an entry in this table by setting its RowStatus object to destroy(6) will stop an active ping operation. The operational state of a ping operation can be determined by examination of its pingResultsOperStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.3,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingResultsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Defines the Ping Results Table for providing the capability of performing ping operations at a remote host. The results of these operations are stored in the pingResultsTable and the pingProbeHistoryTable. An entry is added to the pingResultsTable when an pingCtlEntry is started by successful transition of its pingCtlAdminStatus object to enabled(1). If the object pingCtlAdminStatus already has the value enabled(1), and if the corresponding pingResultsOperStatus object has the value completed(3), then successfully writing enabled(1) to object pingCtlAdminStatus re-initializes the already existing entry in the pingResultsTable. The values of objects in the re-initialized entry are the same as the values of objects in a new entry would be. An entry is removed from the pingResultsTable when its corresponding pingCtlEntry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.3.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingResultsEntry,,not-accessible,pingCtlOwnerIndex:pingCtlTestName,current,,Defines an entry in the pingResultsTable. The pingResultsTable has the same indexing as the pingCtlTable so that a pingResultsEntry corresponds to the pingCtlEntry that caused it to be created.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.4,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingProbeHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Defines a table for storing the results of ping operations. The number of entries in this table is limited per entry in the pingCtlTable by the value of the corresponding pingCtlMaxRows object. An entry in this table is created when the result of a ping probe is determined. The initial 2 instance identifier index values identify the pingCtlEntry that a probe result (pingProbeHistoryEntry) belongs to. An entry is removed from this table when its corresponding pingCtlEntry is deleted. An implementation of this MIB will remove the oldest entry in the pingProbeHistoryTable of the corresponding entry in the pingCtlTable to allow the addition of an new entry once the number of rows in the pingProbeHistoryTable reaches the value specified by pingCtlMaxRows for the corresponding entry in the pingCtlTable.

Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB module require either publication of an RFC, or Designated Expert Review as defined in RFC 2434, Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs. The Designated Expert will be selected by the IESG Area Director(s) of the Routing Area.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.1.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServDataPathTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The data path table contains RowPointers indicating the start of the functional data path for each interface and traffic direction in this device. These may merge, or be separated into parallel data paths.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.1.1.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServDataPathEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:diffServDataPathIfDirection,current,,An entry in the data path table indicates the start of a single Differentiated Services Functional Data Path in this device. These are associated with individual interfaces, logical or physical, and therefore are instantiated by ifIndex. Therefore, the interface index must have been assigned, according to the procedures applicable to that, before it can be meaningfully used. Generally, this means that the interface must exist. When diffServDataPathStorage is of type nonVolatile, however, this may reflect the configuration for an interface whose ifIndex has been assigned but for which the supporting implementation is not currently present.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.1.1.1.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServDataPathIfDirection,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,inbound(1):outbound(2),IfDirection specifies whether the reception or transmission path for this interface is in view.

This RowPointer should point to an instance of one of: diffServClfrEntry diffServMeterEntry diffServActionEntry diffServAlgDropEntry diffServQEntry A value of zeroDotZero in this attribute indicates that no Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path. A pointer with the value zeroDotZero normally terminates a functional data path. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error. If the row pointed to is removed or becomes inactive by other means, the treatment is as if this attribute contains a value of zeroDotZero.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.2,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table enumerates all the diffserv classifier functional data path elements of this device. The actual classification definitions are defined in diffServClfrElementTable entries belonging to each classifier. An entry in this table, pointed to by a RowPointer specifying an instance of diffServClfrStatus, is frequently used as the name for a set of classifier elements, which all use the index diffServClfrId. Per the semantics of the classifier element table, these entries constitute one or more unordered sets of tests which may be simultaneously applied to a message to classify it. The primary function of this table is to ensure that the value of diffServClfrId is unique before attempting to use it in creating a diffServClfrElementEntry. Therefore, the diffServClfrEntry must be created on the same SET as the diffServClfrElementEntry, or before the diffServClfrElementEntry is created.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.2.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrEntry,,not-accessible,diffServClfrId,current,,An entry in the classifier table describes a single classifier. All classifier elements belonging to the same classifier use the classifier's diffServClfrId as part of their index.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.2.1.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrId,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that enumerates the classifier entries. Managers should obtain new values for row creation in this table by reading diffServClfrNextFree.

All writable objects in this row may be modified at any time. Setting this variable to 'destroy' when the MIB contains one or more RowPointers pointing to it results in destruction being delayed until the row is no longer used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.3,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementNextFree,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This object contains an unused value for diffServClfrElementId, or a zero to indicate that none exist.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The classifier element table enumerates the relationship between classification patterns and subsequent downstream Differentiated Services Functional Data Path elements. diffServClfrElementSpecific points to a filter that specifies the classification parameters. A classifier may use filter tables of different types together. One example of a filter table defined in this MIB is diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, for IP Multi-Field Classifiers (MFCs). Such an entry might identify anything from a single micro-flow (an identifiable sub-session packet stream directed from one sending transport to the receiving transport or transports), or aggregates of those such as the traffic from a host, traffic for an application, or traffic between two hosts using an application and a given DSCP. The standard Behavior Aggregate used in the Differentiated Services Architecture is encoded as a degenerate case of such an aggregate - the traffic using a particular DSCP value. Filter tables for other filter types may be defined elsewhere.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementEntry,,not-accessible,diffServClfrId:diffServClfrElementId,current,,An entry in the classifier element table describes a single element of the classifier.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1.1,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementId,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that enumerates the Classifier Element entries. Managers obtain new values for row creation in this table by reading diffServClfrElementNextFree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1.2,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementPrecedence,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The relative order in which classifier elements are applied: higher numbers represent classifier element with higher precedence. Classifier elements with the same order must be unambiguous i.e. they must define non-overlapping patterns, and are considered to be applied simultaneously to the traffic stream. Classifier elements with different order may overlap in their filters: the classifier element with the highest order that matches is taken. On a given interface, there must be a complete classifier in place at all times in the ingress direction. This means one or more filters must match any possible pattern. There is no such requirement in the egress direction.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1.3,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementNext,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This attribute provides one branch of the fan-out functionality of a classifier described in the Informal Differentiated Services Model section 4.1. This selects the next Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Element to handle traffic for this data path. This RowPointer should point to an instance of one of: diffServClfrEntry diffServMeterEntry diffServActionEntry diffServAlgDropEntry diffServQEntry A value of zeroDotZero in this attribute indicates no further Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path. The use of zeroDotZero is the normal usage for the last functional data path element of the current data path. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error. If the row pointed to is removed or becomes inactive by other means, the treatment is as if this attribute contains a value of zeroDotZero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1.4,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementSpecific,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,A pointer to a valid entry in another table, filter table, that describes the applicable classification parameters, e.g. an entry in diffServMultiFieldClfrTable. The value zeroDotZero is interpreted to match anything not matched by another classifier element - only one such entry may exist for each classifier. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error. If the row pointed to is removed or becomes inactive by other means, the element is ignored.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1.5,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementStorage,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row.

All writable objects in this row may be modified at any time. Setting this variable to 'destroy' when the MIB contains one or more RowPointers pointing to it results in destruction being delayed until the row is no longer used.

The value other(1) requires further specification in some other MIB module. In the tailDrop(2) algorithm, diffServAlgDropQThreshold represents the maximum depth of the queue, pointed to by diffServAlgDropQMeasure, beyond which all newly arriving packets will be dropped. In the headDrop(3) algorithm, if a packet arrives when the current depth of the queue, pointed to by diffServAlgDropQMeasure, is at diffServAlgDropQThreshold, packets currently at the head of the queue are dropped to make room for the new packet to be enqueued at the tail of the queue. In the randomDrop(4) algorithm, on packet arrival, an Active Queue Management algorithm is executed which may randomly drop a packet. This algorithm may be proprietary, and it may drop either the arriving packet or another packet in the queue. diffServAlgDropSpecific points to a diffServRandomDropEntry that describes the algorithm. For this algorithm, diffServAlgDropQThreshold is understood to be the absolute maximum size of the queue and additional parameters are described in diffServRandomDropTable. The alwaysDrop(5) algorithm is as its name specifies; always drop. In this case, the other configuration values in this Entry are not meaningful; There is no useful 'next' processing step, there is no queue, and parameters describing the queue are not useful. Therefore, diffServAlgDropNext, diffServAlgDropMeasure, and diffServAlgDropSpecific are all zeroDotZero.

This RowPointer should point to an instance of one of: diffServClfrEntry diffServMeterEntry diffServActionEntry diffServQEntry A value of zeroDotZero in this attribute indicates no further Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path. The use of zeroDotZero is the normal usage for the last functional data path element of the current data path. When diffServAlgDropType is alwaysDrop(5), this object is ignored.

For the tailDrop(2) or headDrop(3) algorithms, this represents the depth of the queue, pointed to by diffServAlgDropQMeasure, at which the drop action will take place. Other algorithms will need to define their own semantics for this threshold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.6.2.1.6,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServAlgDropSpecific,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,Points to a table entry that provides further detail regarding a drop algorithm.

Entries with diffServAlgDropType equal to randomDrop(4) must have this point to an entry in diffServRandomDropTable. For all other algorithms specified in this MIB, this should take the value zeroDotZero. The diffServAlgDropType is authoritative for the type of the drop algorithm and the specific parameters for the drop algorithm needs to be evaluated based on the diffServAlgDropType.

The equation uses diffServRandomDropWeight/65536 as the coefficient for the new sample in the equation, and (65536 - diffServRandomDropWeight)/65536 as the coefficient of the old value. Implementations may limit the values of diffServRandomDropWeight to a subset of the possible range of values, such as powers of two.

This normally is null (zeroDotZero), or points to a diffServSchedulerEntry or a diffServQEntry. However, this RowPointer may also point to an instance of: diffServClfrEntry, diffServMeterEntry, diffServActionEntry, diffServAlgDropEntry. It would point another diffServSchedulerEntry when implementing multiple scheduler methods for the same data path, such as having one set of queues scheduled by WRR and that group participating in a priority scheduling system in which other queues compete with it in that way. It might also point to a second scheduler in a hierarchical scheduling system. If the row pointed to is zeroDotZero, no further Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path.

Note that this attribute value and that of diffServMinRateRelative are coupled: changes to one will affect the value of the other. They are linked by the following equation, in that setting one will change the other: diffServMinRateRelative = (diffServMinRateAbsolute*1000000)/ifSpeed or, if appropriate: diffServMinRateRelative = diffServMinRateAbsolute/ifHighSpeed

A multi-rate shaper has some number of rate levels. Frame Relay's dual rate specification refers to a 'committed' and an 'excess' rate; ATM's dual rate specification refers to a 'mean' and a 'peak' rate. This table is generalized to support an arbitrary number of rates. The committed or mean rate is level 1, the peak rate (if any) is the highest level rate configured, and if there are other rates they are distributed in monotonically increasing order between them.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.3.2.2,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServSchedulerWRR,,,,,,For use with diffServSchedulerMethod to indicate the Weighted Round Robin scheduling method, defined as any algorithm in which a set of queues are visited in a fixed order, and varying amounts of traffic are removed from each queue in turn to implement an average output rate by class. Notice attributes from diffServMinRateEntry of the queues/schedulers feeding this scheduler are used when determining the next packet to schedule.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.3.2.3,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServSchedulerWFQ,,,,,,For use with diffServSchedulerMethod to indicate the Weighted Fair Queuing scheduling method, defined as any algorithm in which a set of queues are conceptually visited in some order, to implement an average output rate by class. Notice attributes from diffServMinRateEntry of the queues/schedulers feeding this scheduler are used when determining the next packet to schedule.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.0,ALARM-MIB::alarmNotifications,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.0.2,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveState,,,,,,An instance of the alarm indicated by alarmActiveModelPointer has been raised against the entity indicated by alarmActiveResourceId. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive alarmActiveState traps so that there is at least a two-second gap between traps of this type against the same alarmActiveModelPointer and alarmActiveResourceId. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. A management application should periodically check the value of alarmActiveLastChanged to detect any missed alarmActiveState notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.0.3,ALARM-MIB::alarmClearState,,,,,,An instance of the alarm indicated by alarmActiveModelPointer has been cleared against the entity indicated by alarmActiveResourceId. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive alarmActiveClear traps so that there is at least a two-second gap between traps of this type against the same alarmActiveModelPointer and alarmActiveResourceId. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. A management application should periodically check the value of alarmActiveLastChanged to detect any missed alarmClearState notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmModel,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelLastChanged,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation, deletion or modification of an entry in the alarmModelTable. If the number and content of entries has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then the value of this object MUST be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of information about possible alarms on the system, and how they have been modelled.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelEntry,,not-accessible,alarmListName:alarmModelIndex:alarmModelState,current,,Entries appear in this table for each possible alarm state. This table MUST be persistent across system reboots.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelIndex,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,An integer that acts as an alarm Id to uniquely identify each alarm within the named alarm list. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.2,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelState,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,A value of 1 MUST indicate a clear alarm state. The value of this object MUST be less than the alarmModelState of more severe alarm states for this alarm. The value of this object MUST be more than the alarmModelState of less severe alarm states for this alarm.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.3,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelNotificationId,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The NOTIFICATION-TYPE object identifier of this alarm state transition. If there is no notification associated with this alarm state, the value of this object MUST be '0.0'
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.4,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelVarbindIndex,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,The index into the varbind listing of the notification indicated by alarmModelNotificationId which helps signal that the given alarm has changed state. If there is no applicable varbind, the value of this object MUST be zero. Note that the value of alarmModelVarbindIndex acknowledges the existence of the first two obligatory varbinds in the InformRequest-PDU and SNMPv2-Trap-PDU (sysUpTime.0 and snmpTrapOID.0). That is, a value of 2 refers to the snmpTrapOID.0. If the incoming notification is instead an SNMPv1 Trap-PDU, then an appropriate value for sysUpTime.0 or snmpTrapOID.0 shall be determined by using the rules in section 3.1 of [RFC3584]
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.5,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelVarbindValue,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value that the varbind indicated by alarmModelVarbindIndex takes to indicate that the alarm has entered this state. If alarmModelVarbindIndex has a value of 0, so MUST alarmModelVarbindValue.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.7,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelSpecificPointer,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,If no additional, model-specific Alarm MIB is supported by the system the value of this object is `0.0'and attempts to set it to any other value MUST be rejected appropriately. When a model-specific Alarm MIB is supported, this object MUST refer to the first accessible object in a corresponding row of the model definition in one of these model-specific MIB and attempts to set this object to { 0 0 } or any other value MUST be rejected appropriately.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.8,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelVarbindSubtree,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The name portion of each VarBind in the notification, in order, is compared to the value of this object. If the name is equal to or a subtree of the value of this object, for purposes of computing the value of AlarmActiveResourceID the 'prefix' will be the matching portion, and the 'indexes' will be any remainder. The examination of varbinds ends with the first match. If the value of this object is 0.0, then the first varbind, or in the case of v2, the first varbind after the timestamp and the trap OID, will always be matched. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.9,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelResourcePrefix,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The value of AlarmActiveResourceId is computed by appending any indexes extracted in accordance with the description of alarmModelVarbindSubtree onto the value of this object. If this object's value is 0.0, then the 'prefix' extracted is used instead. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.1.2.1.10,ALARM-MIB::alarmModelRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),Control for creating and deleting entries. Entries may be modified while active. Alarms whose alarmModelRowStatus is not active will not appear in either the alarmActiveTable or the alarmClearTable. Setting this object to notInService cannot be used as an alarm suppression mechanism. Entries that are notInService will disappear as described in RFC2579. This row can not be modified while it is being referenced by a value of alarmActiveModelPointer. In these cases, an error of `inconsistentValue' will be returned to the manager. This entry may be deleted while it is being referenced by a value of alarmActiveModelPointer. This results in the deletion of this entry and entries in the active alarms referencing this entry via an alarmActiveModelPointer. As all read-create objects in this table have a DEFVAL clause, there is no requirement that any object be explicitly set before this row can become active. Note that a row consisting only of default values is not very meaningful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2,ALARM-MIB::alarmActive,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveLastChanged,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the alarmActiveTable. If the number of entries has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveEntry,,not-accessible,alarmListName:alarmActiveDateAndTime:alarmActiveIndex,current,,Entries appear in this table when alarms are raised. They are removed when the alarm is cleared. If under extreme resource constraint the system is unable to add any more entries into this table, then the alarmActiveOverflow statistic will be increased by one.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmListName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The name of the list of alarms. This SHOULD be the same as nlmLogName if the Notification Log MIB [RFC3014] is supported. This SHOULD be the same as, or contain as a prefix, the applicable snmpNotifyFilterProfileName if the SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB DEFINITIONS [RFC3413] is supported. An implementation may allow multiple named alarm lists, up to some implementation-specific limit (which may be none). A zero-length list name is reserved for creation and deletion by the managed system, and MUST be used as the default log name by systems that do not support named alarm lists.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.2,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveDateAndTime,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The local date and time when the error occurred. This object facilitates retrieving all instances of alarms that have been raised or have changed state since a given point in time. Implementations MUST include the offset from UTC, if available. Implementation in environments in which the UTC offset is not available is NOT RECOMMENDED.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.3,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveIndex,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,A strictly monotonically increasing integer which acts as the index of entries within the named alarm list. It wraps back to 1 after it reaches its maximum value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.4,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The identification of the SNMP engine at which the alarm originated. If the alarm is from an SNMPv1 system this object is a zero length string.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.6,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveEngineAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The address of the SNMP engine on which the alarm is occurring. This object MUST always be instantiated, even if the list can contain alarms from only one engine.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.7,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the SNMP MIB context from which the alarm came. For SNMPv1 alarms this is the community string from the Trap. Note that care MUST be taken when selecting community strings to ensure that these can be represented as a well-formed SnmpAdminString. Community or Context names that are not well-formed SnmpAdminStrings will be mapped to zero length strings. If the alarm's source SNMP engine is known not to support multiple contexts, this object is a zero length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.8,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveVariables,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The number of variables in alarmActiveVariableTable for this alarm.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.11,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveDescription,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object provides a textual description of the active alarm. This text is generated dynamically by the notification generator to provide useful information to the human operator. This information SHOULD provide information allowing the operator to locate the resource for which this alarm is being generated. This information is not intended for consumption by automated tools.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.2.1.12,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveLogPointer,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,A pointer to the corresponding row in a notification logging MIB where the state change notification for this active alarm is logged.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.3.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveVariableEntry,,not-accessible,alarmListName:alarmActiveIndex:alarmActiveVariableIndex,current,,Entries appear in this table when there are variables in the varbind list of a corresponding alarm in alarmActiveTable. Entries appear in this table as though the trap/notification had been transported using a SNMPv2-Trap-PDU, as defined in [RFC3416] - i.e., the alarmActiveVariableIndex 1 will always be sysUpTime and alarmActiveVariableIndex 2 will always be snmpTrapOID. If the incoming notification is instead an SNMPv1 Trap-PDU and the value of alarmModelVarbindIndex is 1 or 2, an appropriate value for sysUpTime.0 or snmpTrapOID.0 shall be determined by using the rules in section 3.1 of [RFC3584].
.1.3.6.1.2.1.118.1.2.3.1.1,ALARM-MIB::alarmActiveVariableIndex,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,A strictly monotonically increasing integer, starting at 1 for a given alarmActiveIndex, for indexing variables within the active alarm variable list.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.158,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamMIB,,,,,,The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile taskforce (IEEE 802.3ah). The functionality presented here is based on IEEE 802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004. [802.3ah] was prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3 [802.3-2002]. Since then, [802.3ah] has been merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005]. In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. The OAM functionality of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah]. The OAM functions are not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of [802.3-2002]. An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM. OAMPDU is used throughout this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol data unit. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [802.3ah] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004: 'Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', October 2004.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.0.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamThresholdEvent,,,,,,A dot3OamThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or remote threshold crossing event is detected. A local threshold crossing event is detected by the local entity, while a remote threshold crossing event is detected by the reception of an Ethernet OAM Event Notification OAMPDU that indicates a threshold event. This notification should not be sent more than once per second. The OAM entity can be derived from extracting the ifIndex from the variable bindings. The objects in the notification correspond to the values in a row instance in the dot3OamEventLogTable. The management entity should periodically check dot3OamEventLogTable to detect any missed events.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.0.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamNonThresholdEvent,,,,,,A dot3OamNonThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or remote non-threshold crossing event is detected. A local event is detected by the local entity, while a remote event is detected by the reception of an Ethernet OAM Event Notification OAMPDU that indicates a non-threshold crossing event. This notification should not be sent more than once per second. The OAM entity can be derived from extracting the ifIndex from the variable bindings. The objects in the notification correspond to the values in a row instance of the dot3OamEventLogTable. The management entity should periodically check dot3OamEventLogTable to detect any missed events.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains the primary controls and status for the OAM capabilities of an Ethernet-like interface. There will be one row in this table for each Ethernet-like interface in the system that supports the OAM functions defined in [802.3ah]. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table that contains information on the Ethernet OAM function for a single Ethernet like interface. Entries in the table are created automatically for each interface supporting Ethernet OAM. The status of the row entry can be determined from dot3OamOperStatus. A dot3OamEntry is indexed in the dot3OamTable by the ifIndex object of the Interfaces MIB. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamAdminState,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),This object is used to provision the default administrative OAM mode for this interface. This object represents the desired state of OAM for this interface. The dot3OamAdminState always starts in the disabled(2) state until an explicit management action or configuration information retained by the system causes a transition to the enabled(1) state. When enabled(1), Ethernet OAM will attempt to operate over this interface. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,disabled(1):linkFault(2):passiveWait(3):activeSendLocal(4):sendLocalAndRemote(5):sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6):oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7):oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8):operational(9):nonOperHalfDuplex(10),At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link. The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OA sublayer. This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the dot3OamAdminState. If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned. Note that the object ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or testing(3)). The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OA capable. The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination. The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet. Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10). If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided. This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11). When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5]. Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface is in half-duplex operation. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.3,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,passive(1):active(2),This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this Ethernet-like interface. OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in 'active' mode or 'passive' mode. These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OA actions with it. As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OA entity cannot. The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of system on which this Ethernet-like interface resides. The default value should be 'active(2)' unless it is known that this system should take on a subservient role to the other device connected over this interface. Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the dot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9). 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.4,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamMaxOamPduSize,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The largest OAMPDU that the OAM entity supports. OA entities exchange maximum OAMPDU sizes and negotiate to use the smaller of the two maximum OAMPDU sizes between the peers. This value is determined by the local implementation. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.5,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamConfigRevision,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The configuration revision of the OAM entity as reflected in the latest OAMPDU sent by the OAM entity. The config revision is used by OAM entities to indicate that configuration changes have occurred, which might require the peer OAM entity to re-evaluate whether OAM peering is allowed. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.6,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamFunctionsSupported,BITS,read-only,,current,unidirectionalSupport(0):loopbackSupport(1):eventSupport(2):variableSupport(3),The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet-like interface. OAM consists of separate functional sets beyond the basic discovery process that is always required. These functional groups can be supported independently by any implementation. These values are communicated to the peer via the local configuration field of Information OAMPDUs. Setting 'unidirectionalSupport(0)' indicates that the OA entity supports the transmission of OAMPDUs on links that are operating in unidirectional mode (traffic flowing in one direction only). Setting 'loopbackSupport(1)' indicates that the OAM entity can initiate and respond to loopback commands. Setting 'eventSupport(2)' indicates that the OAM entity can send and receive Event Notification OAMPDUs. Setting 'variableSupport(3)' indicates that the OAM entity can send and receive Variable Request and Response OAMPDUs. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains information about the OAM peer for a particular Ethernet-like interface. OAM entities communicate with a single OAM peer entity on Ethernet links on which OA is enabled and operating properly. There is one entry in this table for each entry in the dot3OamTable for which information on the peer OAM entity is available. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table containing information on the peer OA entity for a single Ethernet-like interface. Note that there is at most one OAM peer for each Ethernet-like interface. Entries are automatically created when information about the OAM peer entity becomes available, and automatically deleted when the OAM peer entity is no longer in communication. Peer information is not available when dot3OamOperStatus is disabled(1), linkFault(2), passiveWait(3), activeSendLocal(4), or nonOperHalfDuplex(10). 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerMacAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The MAC address of the peer OAM entity. The MAC address is derived from the most recently received OAMPDU. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerVendorOui,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The OUI of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. The OUI can be used to identify the vendor of the remote OA entity. This value is initialized to three octets of zero before any Local Information TLV is received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.3,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerVendorInfo,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The Vendor Info of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. The semantics of the Vendor Information field is proprietary and specific to the vendor (identified by the dot3OamPeerVendorOui). This information could, for example, be used to identify a specific product or product family. This value is initialized to zero before any Local Information TLV is received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.4,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerMode,INTEGER,read-only,,current,passive(1):active(2):unknown(3),The mode of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. The mode of the peer can be determined from the Configuration field in the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer. The value is unknown(3) whenever no Local Information TLV has been received. The values of active(2) and passive(1) are returned when a Local Information TLV has been received indicating that the peer is in active or passive mode, respectively. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.5,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerMaxOamPduSize,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The maximum size of OAMPDU supported by the peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. Ethernet OAM on this interface must not use OAMPDUs that exceed this size. The maximum OAMPDU size can be determined from the PDU Configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer. A value of zero is returned if no Local Information TLV has been received. Otherwise, the value of the OAM peer's maximum OAMPDU size is returned in this value. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.6,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerConfigRevision,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The configuration revision of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest OAMPDU. This attribute is changed by the peer whenever it has a local configuration change for Ethernet OA on this interface. The configuration revision can be determined from the Revision field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. A value of zero is returned if no Local Information TLV has been received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.7,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerFunctionsSupported,BITS,read-only,,current,unidirectionalSupport(0):loopbackSupport(1):eventSupport(2):variableSupport(3),The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet-like interface. OAM consists of separate functionality sets above the basic discovery process. This value indicates the capabilities of the peer OAM entity with respect to these functions. This value is initialized so all bits are clear. If unidirectionalSupport(0) is set, then the peer OAM entity supports sending OAM frames on Ethernet interfaces when the receive path is known to be inoperable. If loopbackSupport(1) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send and receive OAM loopback commands. If eventSupport(2) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send and receive event OAMPDUs to signal various error conditions. If variableSupport(3) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send and receive variable requests to monitor the attribute value as described in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. The capabilities of the OAM peer can be determined from the configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. All zeros are returned if no Local Information TLV has yet been received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains controls for the loopback state of the local link as well as indicates the status of the loopback function. There is one entry in this table for each entry in dot3OamTable that supports loopback functionality (where dot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the loopbackSupport bit set). Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) is echoed back over the same interface on which they were received. In this state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface. Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal data flow and should be used accordingly. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing information on the loopback status for a single Ethernet-like interface. Entries in the table are automatically created whenever the local OAM entity supports loopback capabilities. The loopback status on the interface can be determined from the dot3OamLoopbackStatus object. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,noLoopback(1):initiatingLoopback(2):remoteLoopback(3):terminatingLoopback(4):localLoopback(5):unknown(6),The loopback status of the OAM entity. This status is determined by a combination of the local parser and multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states, as well as by the actions of the local OAM client. When operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the status reads noLoopback(1). The values initiatingLoopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4) can be read or written. The other values can only be read - they can never be written. Writing initiatingLoopback causes the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its peer. This value can only be written when the status is noLoopback(1). Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any other state has no effect. When in remoteLoopback(3), writing terminatingLoopback(4) causes the local OAM entity to initiate the termination of the loopback state. Writing terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect. If the OAM client initiates a loopback and has sent a Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'. In this case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any acknowledgment that the remote OAM entity has received its loopback command request. If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in loopback mode (via the remote state information as described in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is remoteLoopback(3). If the local OAM client is in the process of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3, 30.3.6.1.14] with its local multiplexer and parser states in DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4). If the remote OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as indicated by its local parser state, the status is localLoopback(5). The unknown(6) status indicates that the parser and multiplexer combination is unexpected. This status may be returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist. The values of this attribute correspond to the following values of the local and remote parser and multiplexer states. value LclPrsr LclMux RmtPrsr RmtMux noLoopback FWD FWD FWD FWD initLoopback DISCARD DISCARD FWD FWD rmtLoopback DISCARD FWD LPBK DISCARD tmtngLoopback DISCARD DISCARD LPBK DISCARD lclLoopback LPBK DISCARD DISCARD FWD unknown *** any other combination *** 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackIgnoreRx,INTEGER,read-write,,current,ignore(1):process(2),Since OAM loopback is a disruptive operation (user traffic does not pass), this attribute provides a mechanism to provide controls over whether received OAM loopback commands are processed or ignored. When the value is ignore(1), received loopback commands are ignored. When the value is process(2), OAM loopback commands are processed. The default value is to ignore loopback commands (ignore(1)). 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.4,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains statistics for the OAM function on a particular Ethernet-like interface. There is an entry in the table for every entry in the dot3OamTable. The counters in this table are defined as 32-bit entries to match the counter size as defined in [802.3ah]. Given that the OA protocol is a slow protocol, the counters increment at a slow rate.

Event Notifications may be sent in duplicate to increase the probability of successfully being received, given the possibility that a frame may be lost in transit. Duplicate Event Notification transmissions are counted by dot3OamDuplicateEventNotificationTx. A unique Event Notification OAMPDU is indicated as an Event Notification OAMPDU with a Sequence Number field that is distinct from the previously transmitted Event Notification OAMPDU Sequence Number. Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Event Notification OAMPDUs may be sent in duplicate to increase the probability of successfully being received, given the possibility that a frame may be lost in transit. A duplicate Event Notification OAMPDU is indicated as an Event Notification OAMPDU with a Sequence Number field that is identical to the previously transmitted Event Notification OAMPDU Sequence Number. Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.4.1.17,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamFramesLostDueToOam,Counter32,read-only,,current,,A count of the number of frames that were dropped by the OA multiplexer. Since the OAM multiplexer has multiple inputs and a single output, there may be cases where frames are dropped due to transmit resource contention. This counter is incremented whenever a frame is dropped by the OAM layer. Note that any Ethernet frame, not just OAMPDUs, may be dropped by the OAM layer. This can occur when an OAMPDU takes precedence over a 'normal' frame resulting in the 'normal' frame being dropped. When this counter is incremented, no other counters in this MIB are incremented. Discontinuities of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of the ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.5,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamEventConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Ethernet OAM includes the ability to generate and receive Event Notification OAMPDUs to indicate various link problems. This table contains the mechanisms to enable Event Notifications and configure the thresholds to generate the standard Ethernet OAM events. There is one entry in the table for every entry in dot3OamTable that supports OAM events (where dot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the eventSupport bit set). The values in the table are maintained across changes to dot3OamOperStatus. The standard threshold crossing events are: - Errored Symbol Period Event. Generated when the number of symbol errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a number of symbols (for example, 1,000 symbols out of 1,000,000 had errors). - Errored Frame Period Event. Generated when the number of frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a number of frames (for example, 10 frames out of 1000 had errors). - Errored Frame Event. Generated when the number of frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second had errors). - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event. Generated when the number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds within the last 100 seconds). An errored frame second is defined as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors. There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are not threshold crossing events but which can be enabled/disabled via this table. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.5.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamEventConfigEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,Entries are automatically created and deleted from this table, and exist whenever the OAM entity supports Ethernet OA events (as indicated by the eventSupport bit in dot3OamFunctionsSuppported). Values in the table are maintained across changes to the value of dot3OamOperStatus. Event configuration controls when the local management entity sends Event Notification OAMPDUs to its OAM peer, and when certain event flags are set or cleared in OAMPDUs.

For locally generated events, the time of the event can be accurately retrieved from sysUpTime. For remotely generated events, the time of the event is indicated by the reception of the Event Notification OAMPDU indicating that the event occurred on the peer. A system may attempt to adjust the timestamp value to more accurately reflect the time of the event at the peer OAM entity by using other information, such as that found in the timestamp found of the Event Notification TLVs, which provides an indication of the relative time between events at the peer entity.

The other three are not threshold crossing events. When the OUI is not 71874 (0x0180C2 in hex), then some other organization has defined the event space.

This address object is only significant up to ipMcastRouteGroupPrefixLength bits. The remaining address bits are set to zero. This is especially important for this index field, which is part of the index of this entry. Any non-zero bits would signify an entirely different entry. For addresses of type ipv4z or ipv6z, the appended zone index is significant even though it lies beyond the prefix length. The use of these address types indicate that this forwarding state applies only within the given zone. Zone index zero is not valid in this table.

A value of unicast means that the route would normally be placed only in the unicast RIB, but was placed in the multicast RIB due (instead or in addition) to local configuration, such as when running PIM over RIP. A value of multicast means that the route was explicitly added to the multicast RIB by the routing protocol, such as the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) or Multiprotocol BGP.

Discontinuities in this monotonically increasing value occur at re-initialization of the management system. Discontinuities can also occur as a result of routes being removed and replaced, which can be detected by observing the value of ipMcastRouteTimeStamp.

For RPF checking protocols (such as PIM-SM), these packets arrived on interfaces other than ipMcastRouteInIfIndex, and were dropped because of this failed RPF check. (RPF paths are 'Reverse Path Forwarding' paths; the unicast routes to the expected origin of multicast data flows). Other protocols may drop packets on an incoming interface check for different reasons (for example, BIDIR-PIM performs a DF check on receipt of packets). All packets dropped as a result of an incoming interface check are counted here. If this counter increases rapidly, this indicates a problem. A significant quantity of multicast data is arriving at this router on unexpected interfaces, and is not being forwarded. For guidance, if the rate of increase of this counter exceeds 1% of the rate of increase of ipMcastRouteOctets, then there are multicast routing problems that require investigation. Discontinuities in this monotonically increasing value occur at re-initialization of the management system. Discontinuities can also occur as a result of routes being removed and replaced, which can be detected by observing the value of ipMcastRouteTimeStamp.

Packets with a destination address in the associated address/mask range will not be forwarded over this interface. For IPv4, zone boundaries cut through links. Therefore, this is an external interface. This may be either a physical or virtual interface (tunnel, encapsulation, and so forth.) For IPv6, zone boundaries cut through nodes. Therefore, this is a virtual interface within the node. This is not an external interface, either real or virtual.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.7.1.2.1.1,JUNIPER-PING-MIB::jnxPingCtlOwnerIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which multiple users may need to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner index'. Such an initial index has a syntax of SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security policy. When used in conjunction with such a security policy all entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or group) will have the same value for this initial index. For a given user's entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the column subidentifier. More elaborate configurations are possible.

The first index element, jnxTraceRouteCtlOwnerIndex, is of type SnmpAdminString, a textual convention that allows for use of the SNMPv3 View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 2575 [11], VACM) and allows an management application to identify its entries. The second index, jnxTraceRouteCtlTestName (also an SnmpAdminString), enables the same management application to have multiple outstanding requests.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.8.1.2.1.1,JUNIPER-TRACEROUTE-MIB::jnxTRCtlOwnerIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which multiple users may need to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is used as an 'owner index'. Such an initial index has a syntax of SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security policy. When used in conjunction with such a security policy all entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or group) will have the same value for this initial index. For a given user's entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the column subidentifier. More elaborate configurations are possible.

According to the LDP Specification [RFC3036] a value of 255 or less specifies the default maximum length of 4096 octets, this is why the value of this object starts at 256. The operator should explicitely choose the default value (i.e. 4096), or some other value. The receiving LSR MUST calculate the maximum PDU length for the session by using the smaller of its and its peer's proposals for Max PDU Length.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.36.1.2.3.1.9,JUNIPER-MPLS-LDP-MIB::jnxMplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The 16-bit integer value which is the proposed keep alive hold timer for this LDP Entity.

The Hello Hold time in seconds. An LSR maintains a record of Hellos received from potential peers. This object represents the Hold Time in the Common Hello Parameters TLV of the Hello Message. A value of 0 is a default value and should be interpretted in conjunction with the jnxMplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object. If the value of this object is 0: if the value of the jnxMplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object is false(2), then this specifies that the Hold Time's actual default value is 15 seconds (i.e. the default Hold time for Link Hellos is 15 seconds). Otherwise if the value of the jnxMplsLdpEntityTargetPeer object is true(1), then this specifies that the Hold Time's actual default value is 45 seconds (i.e. the default Hold time for Targeted Hellos is 45 seconds). A value of 65535 means infinite (i.e. wait forever). All other values represent the amount of time in seconds to wait for a Hello Message. Setting the hold time to a value smaller than 15 is not recommended, although not forbidden according to [RFC3036].

This can cause the target machine to allocate  resources for more than 3 minutes to respond to just one i SYN attack, hence wasting resources.  This attribute records the number of SYN attacks.

In the IP header, one of the fields is the fragment  offset field, which indicates one of the fields is the fragment  offset field. It indicates the starting position of the data  contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data of the  original unfragmented packet. When the sum of the offset and  size of one fragmented packet differ from that of the next  fragmented packet, the packets overlap. The server attempting  to reassemble the packet can crash, especially if it is running  an older operating system that has this vulnerability.  When this option is enabled, the security device detects this  discrepancy in a fragmented packet and drops it and this  attribute counts the number of packets dropped.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.39.1.8.1.1.1.1.5,JUNIPER-JS-SCREENING-MIB::jnxJsScreenMonSrcRoute,Counter64,read-only,,current,,IP source route options can be used to hide their true address  and access restricted areas of a network by specifying a  different path. The security device should be able to either  block any packets with loose or strict source route options  set or detect such packets and then record the event for the  ingress interface. This attribute records either the loose source route option or strict source route attack packets.

An ICMP echo request is an IP packet with a pseudo header,  which is 8 bytes long. Therefore, the maximum allowable  size of the data area of an ICMP echo request is 65,507  bytes.  However, many ping implementations allow the user to specify  a packet size larger than 65,507 bytes. A grossly oversized  ICMP packet can trigger a range of adverse system reactions  such as denial of service (DoS), crashing, freezing, and  rebooting.  When the Ping Death option is enabled, the device detects and  rejects such oversized and irregular packet sizes even when  the attacker hides the total packet size by purposefully  fragmenting it.   This attributes counts the ping of death attack packets.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.39.1.8.1.1.1.1.7,JUNIPER-JS-SCREENING-MIB::jnxJsScreenMonAddrSpoof,Counter64,read-only,,current,,One method to gain access to a restricted network is to insert  a bogus source address in the packet header to make the packet  appear to come from a trusted source. This technique is called  IP spoofing. The mechanism to detect IP spoofing relies on  route table entries.   For example, if a packet with source IP address 10.1.1.6 arrives  at port eth3, but the device has a route to 10.1.1.0/24 through  port eth1. IP spoofing checking notes that this address arrived  at an invalid interface as defined in the route table. A valid packet from 10.1.1.6 can only arrive via eth1, not eth3. The  device concludes that the packet has a spoofed source IP address  and discards it.  This attribute records the address spoofing attack packets.

The purpose is to initiate a connection and to  invoke a SYN/ACK segment response. The SYN segment typically does  not contain any data since the IP packet is small and there is  no legitimate reason for it to be fragmented. A fragmented SYN  packet is anomalous and is suspectful. To be cautious, it might  be helpful to block such these fragments from entering the  protected network.  When the syn fragmentation check is enable, the security device  detects and drops the packets when the IP header indicates that  the packet has been fragmented while the SYN flag is set in the  TCP header.

Following linear equation could help deduce a fairly accurate input power value. Linear equation y = mx + b (where m is the slope and b is  the Y intercept) Slope m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) Y intercept b = y - mx Plugging it all together for our example: m = (915.24 - 618.93) / (0.917994 - 0.910191) = 37973.86 b = 915.24 - (37973.86 * 0.917994) = -33944.5 for 700W (y), our efficiency (x) would then be: x = (700 - (-33944.5)) / 37973.86 = 0.912326 = 91% PowerIn = 700W /0.912326 = 767.26W

The main purpose of the threshold configuration table is to configure threshold alarm notifications indicating that a specific performance metric is not being met. Each row in the table represents a Loss Measurement session threshold set for the defined MEP. This table uses five indices. The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific LM session on the selected MEP. The fifth index is the specific threshold set number. Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in this table to set up a threshold set on a configured MEP that has a configured LM session. If two managers try to 'create' the same row at the same time, the first creation would succeed, the second creation attempt would result in an error. The second creation attempt would then need to select a new index value to successfully create a new row. An NE needs to support at least one threshold set for NE SOAM PM compliance. A second threshold set on the NE is desirable. More than two threshold sets can be configured on the NE if supported on the NE. All the objects in the row have a default value that disables the particular threshold measurement. In order to enable a threshold measurement the particular bit in the jnxSoamLmThresholdCfgEnable object is to be set to '1' and the selected threshold measurement is to have a threshold value configured. Non-configured threshold measurements are disabled by default. The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot or restart of a device.

The start time can be disabled (none), immediate, relative, or fixed. The value of 'none' is illegal and a write error will be returned if this value is used. The value of 'immediate' starts the SOAM DM session when the jnxSoamDmCfgEnabled is true. The value of 'fixed' starts the SOAM DM session when the jnxSoamDmFixedStartDateAndTime is less than or equal to the current system date and time and jnxSoamDmCfgEnabled is true. This value is used to implement an On-Demand fixed time PM session.

If the value is 0 (none), there is no time gap between the end of one Measurement Interval and the start of a new Measurement Interval. This is the normal usage case. If the value is greater than one Measurement Interval there is time gap between the end of one Measurement Interval and the start of the next Measurement Interval. The repetition time specifies the time between the start of consecutive Measurement Intervals; hence the gap between the end of one Measurement Interval and the start of the next is equal to the difference between the repetition time and the measurement interval. During this gap, no SOAM PDUs are sent for this session and no measurements are made. If the value is greater 0 but less than or equal to the measurement interval, an error is returned. This object can only be written at row creation time and cannot be modified once it has been created.

The value 'true' indicates that each Measurement Interval starts at a time which is aligned to NE time source hour, if the repetition time (or the Measurement Interval, if the repetition time is 0) is a factor of an hour, i.e. 60min/15min = 4. For instance, a Measurement Interval/Repetition Time of 15 minutes would stop/start the Measurement Interval at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes of an hour. A Measurement Interval/Repetition Time of 7 minutes would not align to the hour since 7 minutes is NOT a factor of an hour, i.e. 60min/7min = 8.6. In this case the behavior is the same as if the object is set to 'false'. The value 'false' indicates that the first Measurement Interval starts at an arbitrary time and each subsequent Measurement Interval starts at a time which is determined by jnxSoamLmCfgRepetitionTime. This object can only be written at row creation time and cannot be modified once it has been created.

The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific DM session on the selected MEP. The fifth index is the Measurement Interval. At least 32 completed Measurement Intervals are to be supported. 96 completed Measurement Intervals are recommended to be supported. If there are at least 32 rows in the table and a new Measurement Interval completes and a new row is to be added to the table, the oldest completed Measurement Interval can be deleted (row deletion). If the measurement interval is other than 15 minutes then a minimum of 8 hours of completed Measurement Intervals are to be supported and 24 hours are recommended to be supported.

The main purpose of the threshold configuration table is to configure threshold alarm notifications indicating that a specific performance metric is not being met. Each row in the table represents a Delay Measurement session threshold set for the defined MEP. This table uses five indices. The first three indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The fourth index is the specific DM session on the selected MEP. The fifth index is the specific threshold set number. Rows in this table are not created automatically. A row is created in this table to set up a threshold set on a configured MEP that has a configured DM session. An NE needs to support at least one threshold set for NE SOAM PM compliance. A second threshold set on the NE is desirable. More than two threshold sets on the NE can be configured if supported on the NE. All the objects in the row have a default value that disables the particular threshold measurement. In order to enable a threshold measurement the particular bit in the jnxSoamDmThresholdCfgEnable object is to be set to '1' and the selected threshold measurement is to have a threshold value configured. Non-configured threshold measurements are disabled by default. The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot or restart of a device.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.3.78.1.3.6,JUNIPER-SOAM-PM-MIB::jnxSoamDmCfgMeasBinTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table includes configuration objects for the Delay Measurement bins to collect stats. Each row in the table is automatically created when the Delay Measurement session is defined for the selected MEP. The number of rows created is based upon three items: the DM type, the number of bins defined for each type, and whether bins are enabled for each type. The first four indices are the same as used to create the DM session: Maintenance Domain, MaNet, MEP identification, and jnxSoamDmCfgIndex. The fifth index is the type of bin, and the sixth index is the bin number. For a dmDmm session all nine types of bins can be created. For a dm1DmmTx session no bins are created. For a dm1DmmRx session only types forwardFrameDelay, forwardIfdv, and forwardFrameDelayRange can be created. The number of bins created for a bin type is based upon: the jnxSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerFrameDelayInterval object, the jnxSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerInterFrameDelayVariationInterval object, the jnxSoamDmCfgNumMeasBinsPerFrameDelayRangeInterval object, and the jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable object. For instance, if a dmDmm session with Bins per Frame Delay Interval set to 5, Bins per Frame Delay Variation Interval set to 3, and Frame Delay Range set to 2 (default), all of the appropriate bits set in jnxSoamDmMeasurementCfgEnable, the following number of rows would be created: For bin types TwoWayFrameDelay(1), forwardFrameDelay(2), and backwardFrameDelay(3) = 5 bins * 3 types = 15 rows For bin types TwoWayIfdv(4), forwardIfdv(5), backwardIfdv(6) = 3 bins * 3 types = 9 rows. For bins types twoWayFrameDelayRange(7), forwardFrameDelayRange(8), backwardFrameDelayRange(9) = 2 bins * 3 types = 6 rows. This gives a total of 30 rows created for the DMM session example. Each value in the bin defaults to 5000us greater than the previous bin, with the first bin default value set to 0. For the delay example above (5 bins), the following default values would be written to the bins: bin 1: 0 (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us) bin 2: 5000 (range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us) bin 3: 10000 (range is 10,000us <= measurement < 15,000us) bin 4: 15000 (range is 15,000us <= measurement < 20,000us) bin 5: 20000 (range is 20,000us <= measurement < infinity) For the delay variation example above (3 bins), the following default values would be written to the bins: bin 1: 0 (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us) bin 2: 5000 (range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us) bin 3: 10000 (range is 10,000us <= measurement < infinity) For the frame delay range example above (2 bins), the following default values would be written to the bins: bin 1: 0 (range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us) bin 2: 5000 (range is 5,000us <= measurement < infinity) The writable objects in this table need to be persistent upon reboot or restart of a device. Rows are only created if the corresponding measurement type has been enabled via the jnxSoamDmCfgMeasurementEnable object.

The upper boundary is defined by the next bin value or infinite for the last bin defined. The measurement boundary for each measurement bin is to be larger than the measurement boundary of the preceding measurement bin. By default, the next bin is set to 5000us larger than the lower bin boundary. The values in a bin boundary object represents the time range used to segregate delay data into the appropriate statistical data bin. For five bins with default values, each bin has the following time range: bin 1 = 0, range is 0us <= measurement < 5,000us bin 2 = 5000, range is 5,000us <= measurement < 10,000us bin 3 = 10000, range is 10,000us <= measurement < 15,000us bin 4 = 15000, range is 15,000us <= measurement < 20,000us < infinity The first bin boundary (jnxSoamDmCfgBinNumber set to 1) always contains the value of 0.

It is assigned by the agent at the point of creation of the jnxBgpM2PeerTable row entry. While its value is guaranteed to be unique at any time, it is otherwise opaque to the management application with respect to its value or the contiguity of jnxBgpM2PeerIndex row instance values across rows of the jnxBgpM2PeerTable. It is used to provide an index structure for other tables whose data is logically per-peer. For explicitly configured peers, this value will remain consistent until this row is deleted by deleting the configured peers. Unconfigured peers will generate a monotonically increasing number when a BGP FSM is built to process the peering session. Values in the jnxBgpM2PeerTable and other tables utilizing jnxBgpM2PeerIndex are expected to remain in existence for an arbitrary time after the unconfigured peer has been deleted in order to allow management applications to extract useful management information for those peers. Thus, an unconfigured peer using the same indices as the jnxBgpM2PeerTable that comes up while this row still exists will re-utilize the same row.

An entry can be created by a network administrator or by an SNMP agent as instructed by an MPLS signaling protocol. An entry in this table MUST correspond to an entry in the mplsTunnelTable in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB. This table shares index objects with that table and sparse augments that table. Thus, an entry in this table can only be created at the same time as or after a corresponding entry in mplsTunnelTable, and an entry in mplsTunnelTable cannot be deleted while a corresponding entry exists in this table. This table entry includes a row status object, but administrative and operational statuses should be taken from mplsTunnelAdminStatus and mplsTunnelOperStatus in the corresponding entry in mplsTunnelTable.

If this LSR is a transit with more than one out-segment, mplsTunnelRole should contain the value transit(2), and mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchRole should have the value branch(2). If this LSR is a transit with one or more out-segments and is also an egress, mplsTunnelRole should contain the value transit(2), and mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchRole should have the value bud(3). If this LSR is an egress with no out-segment and is not the ingress, mplsTunnelRole should contain the value tail(3), and mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchRole should have the value notBranch(1). If this LSR is an egress and has one or more out-segments, mplsTunnelRole should contain the value transit(1), and mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchRole should have the value bud(3).

When a row in this table is in active(1) state, no objects in that row can be modified by the agent except mplsTeP2mpTunnelRowStatus and mplsTeP2mpTunnelStorageType. This object and mplsTunnelRowStatus in the corresponding entry in mplsTunnelTable in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB should be managed together. No objects in a row in this table can be modified when the mplsTunnelRowStatus object in the corresponding row in mplsTunnelTable has value active(1). Note that no admin or oper status objects are provided in this table. The administrative and operational status of P2MP tunnels is taken from the values of mplsTunnelAdminStatus and mplsTunnelOperStatus in the corresponding row mplsTunnelTable.

Negative values are not allowed, as they do not correspond to valid values of mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID. Note that this object offers an unused value for an mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID value at the local LSR when it is a sub-group originator. In other cases, the value of mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID SHOULD be taken from the received value signaled by the signaling protocol and corresponds to the value in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupID.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestTable allows new destinations of P2MP MPLS tunnels to be added to and removed from P2MP tunnels.

An entry can be created by a network administrator or by an SNMP agent as instructed by an MPLS signaling protocol. Entries in this table share some index fields with the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable and the mplsTunnelTable in MPLS-TE-STD-MIB. Entries in this table have no meaning unless there is a corresponding entry in mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable (which, itself, depends on a corresponding entry in mplsTunnelTable). Note that the same destination may be present more than once if it is in more than one sub-group as reflected by the mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOriginType, mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOrigin, mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupID, mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOriginType, mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOrigin, and mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID, index objects. Entries in this table may be created at any time. If created before an entry in the mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable the entries have no meaning, but may be kept ready for the creation of the P2MP tunnel. If created after the entry in mplsTeP2mpTunnelTable, entries in this table may reflect the addition of destinations to active P2MP tunnels. For this reason, entries in this table are equipped with row, admin, and oper status objects.

Since the object mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOrigin must conform to the protocol specification, this object must return either ipv4(1) or ipv6(2) at a transit or egress LSR. At an ingress LSR, there is no source sub-group and this object should return the value unknown(0).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.2,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOrigin,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The TE Router ID (reachable and stable IP address) of the originator of the P2MP sub-group as received on a Path message by a transit or egress LSR. This object is interpreted in the context of mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOriginType. The value of the sub-group originator used on outgoing Path messages is found in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOrigin and is copied from this object unless this LSR is responsible for changing the sub-group ID. At an ingress LSR there is no received Path message. mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOriginType should return unknown(0), and this object should return a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.3,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupID,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The unique identifier assigned by the sub-group originator for this sub-group of this P2MP tunnel as received on a Path message by a transit or egress LSR. The value of the sub-group identifier used on outgoing Path messages is found in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID and is copied from this object unless this LSR is responsible for changing the sub-group ID. At an ingress LSR there is no received Path message, and this object should return zero.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.4,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOriginType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),This object identifies the type of address carried in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOrigin. This object must return either ipv4(1) or ipv6(2) in keeping with the protocol specification.

In many cases, this will be the ingress LSR of the P2MP tunnel and will be the received signaled value as available in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupOrigin. When a signaling protocol is used, this object corresponds to the Sub-Group Originator field in the SENDER_TEMPLATE object. This object is interpreted in the context of mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOriginType.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.6,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupID,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The unique identifier assigned by the sub-group originator for this sub-group of this P2MP tunnel. An appropriate value for this object during row creation when the sub-group origin in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSubGroupOrigin is the local LSR can be obtained by reading mplsTeP2mpTunnelSubGroupIDNext. At an egress, there is no downstream sub-group ID. This object should return the value received from upstream and reported in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestSrcSubGroupID.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.7,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestDestinationType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),This object identifies the type of address carried in mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestDestination. This object forms part of the index of this table and can, therefore, not return the value unknown(0). Similarly, since the object mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestDestination must conform to the protocol specification, this object must return either ipv4(1) or ipv6(2).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.8,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestDestination,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A single destination of this P2MP tunnel. That is, a routable TE address of a leaf. This will often be the TE Router ID of the leaf, but can be any interface address. When a signaling protocol is used, this object corresponds to the S2L Sub-LSP destination address field in the S2L_SUB_LSP object. This object is interpreted in the context of mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestDestinationType.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.9,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestBranchOutSegment,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object identifies the outgoing branch from this LSR towards the destination represented by this table entry. It must be a unique identifier within the scope of this tunnel. If MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is implemented, this object should contain an index into mplsOutSegmentTable. If MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB is not implemented, the LSR should assign a unique value to each branch of the tunnel. The value of this object is also used as an index into mplsTeP2mpTunnelBranchPerfTable.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.10,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestHopTableIndex,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,Index into the mplsTunnelHopTable entry that specifies the explicit route hops for this destination of the P2MP tunnel. This object represents the configured route for the branch of the P2MP tree to this destination and is meaningful only at the head-end (ingress or root) of the P2MP tunnel. Note that many such paths may be configured within the mplsTunnelHopTable for each destination, and that the object mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestPathInUse identifies which path has been selected for use.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.11,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestPathInUse,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,This value denotes the configured path that was chosen as the explicit path to this destination of this P2MP tunnel. This value reflects the secondary index into mplsTunnelHopTable where the primary index comes from mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestHopTableIndex. The path indicated by this object might not exactly match the one signaled and recorded in mplsTunnelCHopTable as specific details of the path might be computed locally. Similarly, the path might not match the actual path in use as recorded in mplsTunnelARHopTable due to the fact that some details of the path may have been resolved within the network. A value of zero denotes that no path is currently in use or available.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.12,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestCHopTableIndex,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,Index into the mplsTunnelCHopTable that identifies the explicit path for this destination of the P2MP tunnel. This path is based on the chosen configured path identified by mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestHopTableIndex and mplsTeP2mpTunnelDestPathInUse, but may have been modified and automatically updated by the agent when computed hops become available or when computed hops get modified. If this destination is the destination of the 'first S2L sub-LSP' then this path will be signaled in the Explicit Route Object. If this destination is the destination of a 'subsequent S2L sub-LSP' then this path will be signaled in a Secondary Explicit Route Object.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.7.1.2.3.1.13,JNX-MPLS-TE-P2MP-STD-MIB::jnxMplsTeP2mpTunnelDestARHopTableIndex,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,Index into the mplsTunnelARHopTable that identifies the actual hops traversed to this destination of the P2MP tunnel. This is automatically updated by the agent when the actual hops becomes available. If this destination is the destination of the 'first S2L sub-LSP' then this path will be signaled in the Recorded Route Object. If this destination is the destination of a 'subsequent S2L sub-LSP' then this path will be signaled in a Secondary Recorded Route Object.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.2636.5.12.1.0.2,MCAST-VPN-MIB::jnxMvpnMvrfChange,,,,,,A mvpnMvrfChange notification signifies a change about a MVRF in the device. The change event can be creation of  the MVRF, deletion of the MVRF or an update on the I-PMSI or S-PMSI configuration of the MVRF. The change event  is indicated by mvpnGenOperStatusChange embedded in  the notification. The user can then query  mvpnGeneralTable, and/or mvpnSpmsiConfigTable to get the details of the change as necessary. Note: Since the creation of a MVRF is often followed by  configuration of I-PMSI and/or S-PMSIs for the MVRF,  more than one (three at most) notifications for a MVRF may  be generated serially, and it is really not necessary to  generate all three of them. An agent may choose to generate a  notification for the last event only, that is for S-PMSI configuration. Similarly, deletion of I-PMSI and S-PMSI configuration on a  MVRF happens before a MVRF is deleted and it is recommended  that the agent send the notification for MVRF deletion  event only.

An MA is a set of MEPs, each configured with a single service instance. This is the part of the complete MA table that is constant across all Bridges in a Maintenance Domain, and across all components of a single Bridge. That part of the MA table that can vary from Bridge component to Bridge component is contained in the dot1agCfmMaCompTable. Creation of a Service Instance establishes a connectionless association among the selected DSAPs. Configuring a Maintenance association Endpoint (MEP) at each of the DSAPs creates a Maintenance Association (MA) to monitor that connectionless connectivity. The MA is identified by a Short MA Name that is unique within the Maintenance Domain and chosen to facilitate easy identification of the Service Instance. Together, the Maintenance Domain Name and the Short MA Name form the Maintenance Association Identifier (MAID) that is carried in CFM Messages to identify incorrect connectivity among Service Instances. A small integer, the Maintenance association Endpoint Identifier (MEPID), identifies each MEP among those configured on a single MA (3.132, 18.2). This table uses two indices, first index is the index of the Maintenance Domain table. The second index is the same as the index of the dot1agCfmMaCompEntry for the same MA.

For all Bridges in which the same MAID {dot1agCfmMdFormat, dot1agCfmMdName, dot1agCfmMaNetFormat, and dot1agCfmMaNetName} is configured, the same set of dot1agCfmMaMepListIdentifiers MUST be configured in the Bridges' dot1agCfmMaMepListTables. This allows each MEP to determine whether or not it is receiving CCMs from all of the other MEPs in the MA. For example, if one were creating a new MA whose MAID were {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'}, that had 2 MEPs, whose MEPIDs were 1 and 3, one could, in Bridge A: 1. Get a new MD index d from dot1agCfmMdTableNextIndex. 2. Create the Maintenance Domain {charString, 'Dom1'}. 3. Get a new MA index a from dot1agCfmMdMaNextIndex [d]. 4. Create the Maintenance Association {charString, 'MA1'}. 5. Create a new dot1agCfmMaMepListEntry for each of the MEPs in the MA: [d, a, 1] and [d, a, 3]. 6. Create one of the new MEPs, say [d, a, 1]. Then, in Bridge B: 7. Do all of these steps 1-6, except for using the other MEPID for the new MEP in Step 6, in this example, MEPID 3. Note that, when creating the MA, MEP List Table, and MEP entries in the second Bridge, the indices 'd' and 'a' identifying the MAID {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'} may have different values than those in the first Bridge.

.1.3.111.2.802.1.1.8.1.7.1,IEEE8021-CFM-MIB::dot1agCfmMepTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The Maintenance Association Endpoint (MEP) table. Each row in the table represents a different MEP. A MEP is an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive CFM PDUs and track any responses. It is an endpoint of a single Maintenance Association, and is an endpoint of a separate Maintenance Entity for each of the other MEPs in the same Maintenance Association (3.132). This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain and MA tables, the reason being that a MEP is always related to an MA and Maintenance Domain. The MEP table also stores all the managed objects for sending LBM and LTM. *LBM Managed objects LBM Managed objects in the MEP table enables the management entity to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. It will signal the MEP that it SHOULD transmit some number of Loopback messages and detect the detection (or lack thereof) of the corresponding Loopback messages. Steps to use entries in this table: 1) Wait for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value to be false. To do this do this sequence: a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU). b. Check if value for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus is false. - if not, wait x seconds, go to step a above. - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go to step 2) below 2) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from false to true to ensure no other management entity will use the service. In order to not disturb a possible other NMS do this by sending an SNMP SET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU, and make sure SNmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind). For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you obtained in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating NMSes will not step on each others toes. Setting this MIB object does not set the corresponding LBIactive state machine variable. 3) Setup the different data to be sent (number of messages, optional TLVs,...), except do not set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages. 4) Record the current values of dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu. 6) Set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages to a non-zero value to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. The dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages indicates the number of LBMs to be sent and is not decremented as loopbacks are actually sent. dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages is not equivalent to the LBMsToSend state machine variable. 7) Check the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmResultOK to find out if the operation was successfully initiated or not. 8) Monitor the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus. When it is reset to false, the last LBM has been transmitted. Wait an additional 5 seconds to ensure that all LBRs have been returned. 9) Compare dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu to their old values from step 4, above, to get the results of the test. *LTM Managed objects The LTM Managed objects in the MEP table are used in a manner similar to that described for LBM transmission, above. A SET operation to the variable dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmFlags triggers the transmission of an LTM. Then, the variables dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmSeqNumber and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmEgressIdentifier return the information required to recover the resu
