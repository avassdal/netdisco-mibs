.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17,IF-MIB::ifOutUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.1,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwarding,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,forwarding(1):not-forwarding(2),The indication of whether this entity is acting as an IP gateway in respect to the forwarding of datagrams received by, but not addressed to, this entity. IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcasts addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipAdEntReasmMaxSize,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The size of the largest IP datagram which this entity can re-assemble from incoming IP fragmented datagrams received on this interface.

Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric1,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The primary routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric2,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric3,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteType,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,other(1):invalid(2):direct(3):indirect(4),The type of route. Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipRouteType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.9,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteProto,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,other(1):local(2):netmgmt(3):icmp(4):egp(5):ggp(6):hello(7):rip(8):is-is(9):es-is(10):ciscoIgrp(11):bbnSpfIgp(12):ospf(13):bgp(14),The routing mechanism via which this route was learned.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteAge,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The number of seconds since this route was last updated or otherwise determined to be correct. Note that no semantics of `too old' can be implied except through knowledge of the routing protocol by which the route was learned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.11,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMask,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,Indicate the mask to be logical-ANDed with the destination address before being compared to the value in the ipRouteDest field. For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0. It should be noted that all IP routing subsystems implicitly use this mechanism.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMetric5,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An alternate routing metric for this route. The semantics of this metric are determined by the routing-protocol specified in the route's ipRouteProto value. If this metric is not used, its value should be set to -1.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection. As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note however that RST segments are not sent reliably).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.14.14,OSPF-MIB::ospfAreaAggregateTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The Area Aggregate Table acts as an adjunct to the Area Table. It describes those address aggregates that are configured to be propagated from an area. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of information that is known beyond an Area's borders. It contains a set of IP address ranges specified by an IP address/IP network mask pair. For example, a class B address range of X.X.X.X with a network mask of 255.255.0.0 includes all IP addresses from X.X.0.0 to X.X.255.255. Note that if ranges are configured such that one range subsumes another range (e.g., 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 and 10.1.0.0 mask 255.255.0.0), the most specific match is the preferred one.

This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry.

This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.

Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The history of which this entry is a part. The history identified by a particular value of this index is the same history as identified by the same value of historyControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.3.1.4,TOKEN-RING-RMON-MIB::tokenRingMLHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3,RMON-MIB::alarm,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.

This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTimeCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostTime table among those entries associated with the same hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hostControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

When the associated hostTopNTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the hostTopNTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this hostTopNControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostTopNRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of hosts requested for the top N table.

The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet.

After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::filterOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::filterStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this filter entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2,RMON-MIB::channelTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of packet channel entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1,RMON-MIB::channelEntry,,not-accessible,channelIndex,current,,A set of parameters for a packet channel applied on a particular interface. As an example, an instance of the channelMatches object might be named channelMatches.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::channelIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the channel table. Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::channelIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the interface on this remote network monitoring device to which the associated filters are applied to allow data into this channel. The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::channelDescription,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A comment describing this channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::channelOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::channelStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this channel entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3,RMON2-MIB::channel2Table,,not-accessible,,current,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1,RMON2-MIB::channel2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::channelDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4,RMON2-MIB::filter2Table,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1,RMON2-MIB::filter2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirDataLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with performs the following operations on every packet: 1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by this object, discard the packet and exit (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified protocol). 2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by that object, discard the packet and exit. 3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the filterOffset value to move further into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with will discard the packet if the packet doesn't match this protocol directory entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8,RMON-MIB::capture,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of buffers control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,current,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters. As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCapturedPackets,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets currently in this captureBuffer.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTurnOnTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this capture buffer was first turned on.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::bufferControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::bufferControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this buffer Control Entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the captureBuffer table associated with a particular bufferControlEntry. This index will start at 1 and increase by one for each new packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex. Should this value reach 2147483647, the next packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex shall cause this value to wrap around to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketTime,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of milliseconds that had passed since this capture buffer was first turned on when this packet was captured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9,RMON-MIB::event,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1,RMON-MIB::eventTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of events to be generated.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1,RMON-MIB::eventEntry,,not-accessible,eventIndex,current,,A set of parameters that describe an event to be generated when certain conditions are met. As an example, an instance of the eventLastTimeSent object might be named eventLastTimeSent.6

In the case of log, an entry is made in the log table for each event. In the case of snmp-trap, an SNMP trap is sent to one or more management stations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::eventCommunity,OCTET,read-create,,current,,If an SNMP trap is to be sent, it will be sent to the SNMP community specified by this octet string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::eventLastTimeSent,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this event entry last generated an event. If this entry has not generated any events, this value will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::eventOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it. If this object contains a string starting with 'monitor' and has associated entries in the log table, all connected management stations should retrieve those log entries, as they may have significance to all management stations connected to this device

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.9.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::logIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the log table amongst those generated by the same eventEntries. These indexes are assigned beginning with 1 and increase by one with each new log entry. The association between values of logIndex and logEntries is fixed for the lifetime of each logEntry. The agent may choose to delete the oldest instances of logEntry as required because of lack of memory. It is an implementation-specific matter as to when this deletion may occur.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.10,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this protocol directory entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this protocolDistControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this row. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13,RMON2-MIB::addressMap,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this entry in the addressMapControlTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for this addressMapControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this addressMap control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last created or the values of the physical address changed. This can be used to help detect duplicate address problems, in which case this object will be updated frequently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14,RMON2-MIB::nlHost,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated nlHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been deleted from the nlHost table (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the nlHostTable on behalf of this control entry. The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.7,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlAlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated alHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alHostTable is not implemented or is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.8,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlAlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an alHost entry has been inserted into the alHost table.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2,RMON2-MIB::nlHostTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular network layer address that has been discovered on an interface of this device. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirHostConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirHostConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all addresses seen as the source or destination address in all packets with no MAC errors, and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1,RMON2-MIB::nlHostEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex:nlHostTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:nlHostAddress,current,,A conceptual row in the nlHostTable. The hlHostControlIndex value in the index identifies the hlHostControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the nlHostAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is nlHostOutPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::nlHostTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::nlHostAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this nlHostEntry. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::nlHostInPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets without errors transmitted to this address since it was added to the nlHostTable. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlHostOutPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets without errors transmitted by this address since it was added to the nlHostTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::nlHostOutMacNonUnicastPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets without errors transmitted by this address that were directed to any MAC broadcast addresses or to any MAC multicast addresses since this host was added to the nlHostTable. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlHostCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the entry has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) matrix control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level matrix tables containing conversation statistics indexed by pairs of network addresses. Both the network- and application-level matrix tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer matrix records in memory, it can derive network-layer matrix records from them.) Entries in the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alMatrix tables, entries in the alMatrix tables will be created on behalf of each entry in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlMatrixControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlMatrixControlTable. An example of indexing of this entry is hlMatrixControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlMatrixControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers conversations on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlMatrixSDTable and the nlMatrixDSTable, and optionally the alMatrixSDTable and alMatrixDSTable, on behalf of this hlMatrixControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of the data for the associated matrix tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlMatrixTables are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been inserted into the nlMatrix tables. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The addition of a conversation into both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two insertions (even though every addition into one table must be accompanied by an insertion into the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the sum of then nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable sizes can be determined by subtracting hlMatrixControlNlDeletes from hlMatrixControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been deleted from the nlMatrix tables (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The deletion of a conversation from both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two deletions (even though every deletion from one table must be accompanied by a deletion from the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlMatrixControlNlDeletes from hlMatrixControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the nlMatrix tables on behalf of this control entry. The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alMatrixTables are not implemented or are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.8,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlAlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an alMatrix entry has been inserted into the alMatrix tables. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2.

If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The deletion of a conversation from both the alMatrixSDTable and alMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two deletions (even though every deletion from one table must be accompanied by a deletion from the other).

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object.

This table is indexed first by the source address and then by the destination address to make it convenient to collect all conversations from a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all pairs of addresses seen in all packets with no MAC errors and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors. Further, this table will only contain entries that have a corresponding entry in the nlMatrixDSTable with the same source address and destination address.

When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the nlMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate or nlMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.10,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed.

When this object is created or modified, the probe should set usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.7,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this variable history control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the usrHistoryTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A list of MIB instances to be sampled periodically. Entries in this table are created when an associated usrHistoryControlObjects object is created. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index is that of the associated usrHistoryControlEntry. For example, an instance of usrHistoryObjectVariable might be usrHistoryObjectVariable.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19,RMON2-MIB::probeConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.1,RMON2-MIB::probeCapabilities,BITS,read-only,,current,etherStats(0):historyControl(1):etherHistory(2):alarm(3):hosts(4):hostTopN(5):matrix(6):filter(7):capture(8):event(9):tokenRingMLStats(10):tokenRingPStats(11):tokenRingMLHistory(12):tokenRingPHistory(13):ringStation(14):ringStationOrder(15):ringStationConfig(16):sourceRouting(17):protocolDirectory(18):protocolDistribution(19):addressMapping(20):nlHost(21):nlMatrix(22):alHost(23):alMatrix(24):usrHistory(25):probeConfig(26),An indication of the RMON MIB groups supported on at least one interface by this probe.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to '0.0.0.0' when no IP address has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.8,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadAction,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notDownloading(1):downloadToPROM(2):downloadToRAM(3),When this object is set to downloadToRAM(3) or downloadToPROM(2), the device will discontinue its normal operation and begin download of the image specified by probeDownloadFile from the server specified by probeDownloadTFTPServer using the TFTP protocol. If downloadToRAM(3) is specified, the new image is copied to RAM only (the old image remains unaltered in the flash EPROM). If downloadToPROM(2) is specified, the new image is written to the flash EPROM memory after its checksum has been verified to be correct. When the download process is completed, the device will warm boot to restart the newly loaded application. When the device is not downloading, this object will have a value of notDownloading(1). This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.

This object will have a value of downloadStatusUnknown(2) if no download process has been performed. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.10,RMON2-MIB::serialConfigTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,A table of serial interface configuration entries.

If either the netConfigIPAddress or netConfigSubnetMask is 0.0.0.0, then when the device boots, it may use BOOTP to try to figure out what these values should be. If BOOTP fails before the device can talk on the network, this value must be configured (e.g., through a terminal attached to the device). If BOOTP is used, care should be taken to not send BOOTP broadcasts too frequently and to eventually send them very infrequently if no replies are received.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

A row creation operation in this table for an entry with a local VlanIndex value may fail if the current value of this object is not used as the index. Even if the value read is used, there is no guarantee that it will still be the valid index when the create operation is attempted; another manager may have already got in during the intervening time interval. In this case, dot1qNextFreeLocalVlanIndex should be re-read and the creation re-tried with the new value. This value will automatically change when the current value is used to create a new row.

The value enabled(1) indicates that GVRP is enabled on this port, as long as dot1qGvrpStatus is also enabled for this device. When disabled(2) but dot1qGvrpStatus is still enabled for the device, GVRP is disabled on this port: any GVRP packets received will be silently discarded, and no GVRP registrations will be propagated from other ports. This object affects all GVRP Applicant and Registrar state machines on this port. A transition from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will cause a reset of all GVRP state machines on this port. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

This object MAY be implemented as a read-only object by those agents and MAUs that do not implement software control of the MAU state. Some agents may not support setting the value of this object to some of the enumerated values. The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in a state other than one of the states 2 through 6. The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's true state is unknown; for example, when it is being initialized. A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully functional; it operates, and passes signals to its attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to its specification. A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to idle, and the media transmitter to idle or fault, if supported. Standby(4) mode only applies to link type MAUs. The state of rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected. A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter, as though it were powered down or not connected. The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects when it is in this state. For an AUI, this state will remove power from the AUI. Setting this variable to the value reset(6) resets the MAU in the same manner as a power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half second would. The agent is not required to return the value reset(6). Setting this variable to the value operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5) causes the MAU to assume the respective state, except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the shutdown state.

A value that uniquely identifies the set of possible IEEE 802.3 types that the MAU could be. The value is a sum that initially takes the value zero. Then, for each type capability of this MAU, 2 raised to the power noted below is added to the sum. For example, a MAU that has the capability to be only 10BASE-T would have a value of 512 (2**9). In contrast, a MAU that supports both 10Base-T (full duplex) and 100BASE-TX (full duplex) would have a value of ((2**11) + (2**16)), or 67584. The powers of 2 assigned to the capabilities are these: Power Capability 0 other or unknown 1 AUI 2 10BASE-5 3 FOIRL 4 10BASE-2 5 10BASE-T duplex mode unknown 6 10BASE-FP 7 10BASE-FB 8 10BASE-FL duplex mode unknown 9 10BROAD36 10 10BASE-T half duplex mode 11 10BASE-T full duplex mode 12 10BASE-FL half duplex mode 13 10BASE-FL full duplex mode 14 100BASE-T4 15 100BASE-TX half duplex mode 16 100BASE-TX full duplex mode 17 100BASE-FX half duplex mode 18 100BASE-FX full duplex mode 19 100BASE-T2 half duplex mode 20 100BASE-T2 full duplex mode If auto-negotiation is present on this MAU, this object will map to ifMauAutoNegCapability.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.26.2.1.1.11,MAU-MIB::ifMauDefaultType,OBJECT,read-write,,current,,This object identifies the default administrative baseband MAU type to be used in conjunction with the operational MAU type denoted by ifMauType. The set of possible values for this object is the same as the set defined for the ifMauType object. This object represents the administratively-configured type of the MAU. If auto-negotiation is not enabled or is not implemented for this MAU, the value of this object determines the operational type of the MAU. In this case, a set to this object will force the MAU into the specified operating mode. If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value of this object denotes the type to which the MAU will automatically revert if/when auto-negotiation is later disabled. NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: It may be necessary to provide for underlying hardware implementations which do not follow the exact behavior specified above. In particular, when ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled to disabled, the agent implementation MUST ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to the value specified by this object, rather than continuing to operate at the value earlier determined by the auto-negotiation function.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.26.5.1,MAU-MIB::ifMauAutoNegTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Configuration and status objects for the auto-negotiation function of MAUs attached to interfaces. The ifMauAutoNegTable applies to systems in which auto-negotiation is supported on one or more MAUs attached to interfaces. Note that if auto-negotiation is present and enabled, the ifMauType object reflects the result of the auto-negotiation function.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.26.5.1.1,MAU-MIB::ifMauAutoNegEntry,,not-accessible,ifMauIfIndex:ifMauIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing configuration and status information for the auto-negotiation function of a particular MAU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.26.5.1.1.1,MAU-MIB::ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Setting this object to enabled(1) will cause the interface that has the auto-negotiation signaling ability to be enabled. If the value of this object is disabled(2) then the interface will act as it would if it had no auto-negotiation signaling. Under these conditions, an IEEE 802.3 MAU will immediately be forced to the state indicated by the value of the object ifMauDefaultType. NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS: When ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled to disabled, the agent implementation MUST ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to the value specified by the ifMauDefaultType object, rather than continuing to operate at the value earlier determined by the auto-negotiation function.

A value that uniquely identifies the set of capabilities of the local auto-negotiation entity. The value is a sum that initially takes the value zero. Then, for each capability of this interface, 2 raised to the power noted below is added to the sum. For example, an interface that has the capability to support only 100Base-TX half duplex would have a value of 32768 (2**15). In contrast, an interface that supports both 100Base-TX half duplex and 100Base-TX full duplex would have a value of 98304 ((2**15) + (2**16)). The powers of 2 assigned to the capabilities are these: Power Capability 0 other or unknown (1-9) (reserved) 10 10BASE-T half duplex mode 11 10BASE-T full duplex mode 12 (reserved) 13 (reserved) 14 100BASE-T4 15 100BASE-TX half duplex mode 16 100BASE-TX full duplex mode 17 (reserved) 18 (reserved) 19 100BASE-T2 half duplex mode 20 100BASE-T2 full duplex mode Note that interfaces that support this MIB may have capabilities that extend beyond the scope of this MIB.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.14,IF-MIB::ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Indicates whether linkUp/linkDown traps should be generated for this interface. By default, this object should have the value enabled(1) for interfaces which do not operate on 'top' of any other interface (as defined in the ifStackTable), and disabled(2) otherwise.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.15,IF-MIB::ifHighSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in units of 1,000,000 bits per second. If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.17,IF-MIB::ifConnectorPresent,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has the value 'true(1)' if the interface sublayer has a physical connector and the value 'false(2)' otherwise.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:ifRcvAddressAddress,current,,A list of objects identifying an address for which the system will accept packets/frames on the particular interface identified by the index value ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.1,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,An address for which the system will accept packets/frames on this entry's interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTableLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable. If the number of entries has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.6,IF-MIB::ifStackLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last change of the (whole) interface stack. A change of the interface stack is defined to be any creation, deletion, or change in value of any instance of ifStackStatus. If the interface stack has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per physical entity. There is always at least one row for an 'overall' physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical entity. Each entry provides objects (entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalVendorType, and entPhysicalClass) to help an NMS identify and characterize the entry and objects (entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalParentRelPos) to help an NMS relate the particular entry to other entries in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of physical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalVendorType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to an enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device. If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entPhysicalChildIndex,current,,A single container/'containee' relationship.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalChildIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the contained physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entityGeneral,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time a conceptual row is created, modified, or deleted in any of these tables: - entPhysicalTable - entLogicalTable - entLPMappingTable - entAliasMappingTable - entPhysicalContainsTable 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTraps,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.

Implementation  of this trap is optional.  This object is deprecated in the IP Version MIB. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.0.3,VRRP-MIB::vrrpTrapProtoError,,,,,,The error trap indicates that the sending agent has  encountered the protocol error indicated by  vrrpTrapProtoErrorReason.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.1,VRRP-MIB::vrrpNodeVersion,Integer32,read-only,,deprecated,,This value identifies the particular version of the VRRP  supported by this node.  This object is deprecated in the IP Version Independent  MIB.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.2,VRRP-MIB::vrrpNotificationCntl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Indicates whether the VRRP-enabled router will generate  SNMP notifications for events defined in this MIB.  'Enabled' results in SNMP notifications; 'disabled', no  notifications are sent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,Operations table for a VRRP router which consists of a  sequence (i.e., one or more conceptual rows) of  'vrrpOperEntry' items.  This table has been deprecated as a new IP version  neutral 'vrrpOperationsTable' has been added. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:vrrpOperVrId,deprecated,,An entry in the vrrpOperTable containing the operational  characteristics of a virtual router. On a VRRP router,  a given virtual router is identified by a combination  of the IF index and VRID.  Rows in the table cannot be modified unless the value  of `vrrpOperAdminState' is `disabled' and the  `vrrpOperState' has transitioned to `initialize'.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  independent object, vrrpOperationsEntry
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.1,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperVrId,Integer32,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This object contains the Virtual Router Identifier  (VRID).  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  independent object, vrrpOperationsVrId 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.2,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,The virtual MAC address of the virtual router. Although  this object can be derived from the 'vrrpOperVrId' object,  it is defined so that it is easily obtainable by a  management application and can be included in VRRP-related  SNMP traps.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsVirtualMacAddr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.3,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperState,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,initialize(1):backup(2):master(3),The current state of the virtual router. This object has  three defined values:  - `initialize', which indicates that all the  virtual router is waiting for a startup event.  - `backup', which indicates the virtual router is  monitoring the availability of the master router.  - `master', which indicates that the virtual router  is forwarding packets for IP addresses that are  associated with this router.  Setting the `vrrpOperAdminState' object (below) initiates  transitions in the value of this object.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsState.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.4,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAdminState,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,up(1):down(2),This object will enable/disable the virtual router  function.   Setting the value to `up', will transition the state of  the virtual router from `initialize' to `backup' or  `master', depending on the value of `vrrpOperPriority'.   Setting the value to `down', will transition the router  from `master' or `backup' to `initialize'. State  transitions may not be immediate; they sometimes depend on  other factors, such as the interface (IF) state.   The `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be set to `down' prior  to modifying the other read-create objects in the  conceptual row. The value of the `vrrpOperRowStatus'  object (below) must be `active', signifying that the  conceptual row is valid (i.e., the objects are correctly  set), in order for this object to be set to `up'.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsState.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.5,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperPriority,Integer32,read-create,,deprecated,,This object specifies the priority to be used for the  virtual router master election process. Higher values  imply higher priority.  A priority of '0', although not settable, is sent by  the master router to indicate that this router has ceased  to participate in VRRP and a backup virtual router should  transition to become a new master.  A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the  associated IP address(es).  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsPriority.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.6,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperIpAddrCount,Integer32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of IP addresses that are associated with this  virtual router. This number is equal to the number of  rows in the vrrpAssoIpAddrTable that correspond to a  given IF index/VRID pair.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.8,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperPrimaryIpAddr,IpAddress,read-create,,deprecated,,In the case where there is more than one IP address for  a given `ifIndex', this object is used to specify the IP  address that will become the `vrrpOperMasterIpAddr',  should the virtual router transition from backup to  master. If this object is set to 0.0.0.0, the IP address  which is numerically lowest (of all the associated IP  address for the interface) will be selected.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.9,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAuthType,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,noAuthentication(1):simpleTextPassword(2):ipAuthenticationHeader(3),Authentication type used for VRRP protocol exchanges  between virtual routers. This value of this object is the  same for a given ifIndex.  New enumerations to this list can only be added via a new  RFC on the standards track.  This object is deprecated in the IP Version MIB.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.10,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAuthKey,OCTET,read-create,,deprecated,,The Authentication Key. This object is set according to  the value of the 'vrrpOperAuthType' object  ('simpleTextPassword' or 'ipAuthenticationHeader'). If  the length of the value is less than 16 octets, the agent  will left adjust and zero fill to 16 octets. The value of  this object is the same for a given ifIndex.  When read, vrrpOperAuthKey always returns an Octet String  of length zero.  This object is deprecated in the IP Version MIB.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.11,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAdvertisementInterval,Integer32,read-create,,deprecated,,The time interval, in seconds, between sending  advertisement messages. Only the master router sends  VRRP advertisements.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsAdvInterval. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.12,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperPreemptMode,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,true(1):false(2),Controls whether a higher priority virtual router will  preempt a lower priority master.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsPreemptMode. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.13,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperVirtualRouterUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,deprecated,,This is the value of the `sysUpTime' object when this  virtual router (i.e., the `vrrpOperState') transitioned  out of `initialized'.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsUpTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.14,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperProtocol,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,ip(1):bridge(2):decnet(3):other(4),The particular protocol being controlled by this Virtual  Router.  New enumerations to this list can only be added via a new  RFC on the standards track.  This object is deprecated in the IP Version Independent  MIB.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.15,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The RowStatus variable, used in accordance to  installation and removal conventions for conceptual rows.  The RowStatus of a currently active row in the  vrrpOperTable is constrained by the operational state of  the corresponding virtual router.  When `vrrpOperRowStatus' is set to active(1), no other  objects in the conceptual row, with the exception of  `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified. Prior to setting  the `vrrpOperRowStatus' object from `active' to a  different value, the `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be  set to `down' and the `vrrpOperState' object be  transitioned to `initialize'.  To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object  to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until  instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately  configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the  `vrrpOperRowStatus' column will be read as notReady(3).  In particular, a newly created row cannot be made  active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance of  `vrrpOperVrId' has been set and there is at least one  active row in the `vrrpAssoIpAddrTable' defining an  associated IP address for the virtual router.

A priority of '0', although not settable, is sent by  the master router to indicate that this router has  ceased to participate in VRRP and a backup virtual  router should transition to become a new master.   A priority of 255 is used for the router that owns the  associated IP address(es) for VRRP over IPv4 and hence  not settable.  A 'badValue(3)' should be returned when a user tries to  set 0 or 255 for this object. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.7.1.6,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperationsAddrCount,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of IP addresses that are associated with  this virtual router. This number is equal to the  number of rows in the vrrpAssociatedAddrTable that  correspond to a given IP version/VRID/ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.7.1.7,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperationsMasterIpAddr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The master router's real IP address. Master router  would set this address to vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr  while transitioning to master state. For backup  routers, this is the IP address listed as the source in  VRRP advertisement last received by this virtual  router.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.7.1.8,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,In the case where there are more than one IP  Address (associated IP addresses) for a given  `ifIndex', this object is used to specify the IP  address that will become the  vrrpOperationsMasterIpAddr', should the virtual router  transition from backup state to master.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.7.1.9,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperationsAdvInterval,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,The time interval, in centiseconds, between sending  advertisement messages. Only the master router sends  VRRP advertisements.

When `vrrpOperationsRowStatus' is set to  active(1), no other objects in the conceptual row can  be modified.   To create a row in this table, a manager sets this  object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).  Until instances of all corresponding columns are  appropriately configured, the value of the  corresponding instance of the `vrrpOperationsRowStatus'  column will be read as notReady(3).

To create a row in this table, a manager sets  this object to either createAndGo(4) or  createAndWait(5). Setting this object to active(1)  results in the addition of an associated address for a  virtual router. Setting this object to notInService(2)  results in administratively bringing down the row.  Destroying the entry or setting it to destroy(6)  removes the associated address from the virtual router.  The use of other values is implementation-dependent.  Only vrrpAssociatedStorageType can be modified when the  row is in active(1) state for Implementations  supporting write access to vrrpAssociatedStorageType  Implementations should not allow deletion of the last  row corresponding to an active row in  vrrpOperationsTable.  Refer to description of vrrpOperationsRowStatus for a  typical row creation and deletion scenarios.

Note that if using static RP configuration, this is in addition to, not instead of, the pimStaticRPTable entries that must be configured for the Anycast-RPs. The set of rows with the same values of both pimAnycastRPSetAddressType and pimAnycastRPSetAnycastAddress corresponds to the Anycast-RP set for that Anycast-RP address. When an Anycast-RP set configuration is active, one entry per pimAnycastRPSetAnycastAddress corresponds to the local router. The local router is identified by the pimAnycastRpSetLocalRouter object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.13,PIM-STD-MIB::pimGroupMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The (conceptual) table listing mappings from multicast group prefixes to the PIM mode and RP address to use for groups within that group prefix. Rows in this table are created for a variety of reasons, indicated by the value of the pimGroupMappingOrigin object. - Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'fixed' are created automatically by the router at startup, to correspond to the well-defined prefixes of link-local and unroutable group addresses. These rows are never destroyed. - Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'embedded' are created by the router to correspond to group prefixes that are to be treated as being in Embedded-RP format. - Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configRp' are created and destroyed as a result of rows in the pimStaticRPTable being created and destroyed. - Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configSsm' are created and destroyed as a result of configuration of SSM address ranges to the local router. - Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'bsr' are created as a result of running the PIM Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism. If the local router is not the elected BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages received from the elected BSR. If the local router is the elected BSR, these rows are created to correspond to group prefixes in the PIM Bootstrap messages that the local router sends. In either case, these rows are destroyed when the group prefixes are timed out by the BSR mechanism. - Rows with a pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'other' are created and destroyed according to some other mechanism not specified here. Given the collection of rows in this table at any point in time, the PIM mode and RP address to use for a particular group is determined using the following algorithm. 1. From the set of all rows, the subset whose group prefix contains the group in question are selected. 2. If there are no such rows, then the group mapping is undefined. 3. If there are multiple selected rows, and a subset is defined by pimStaticRPTable (pimGroupMappingOrigin value of 'configRp') with pimStaticRPOverrideDynamic set to TRUE, then this subset is selected. 4. From the selected subset of rows, the subset that have the greatest value of pimGroupMappingGrpPrefixLength are selected. 5. If there are still multiple selected rows, the subset that has the highest precedence (the lowest numerical value for pimGroupMappingPrecedence) is selected. 6. If there are still multiple selected rows, the row selected is implementation dependent; the implementation might or might not apply the PIM hash function to select the row. 7. The group mode to use is given by the value of pimGroupMappingPimMode from the single selected row; the RP to use is given by the value of pimGroupMappingRPAddress, unless pimGroupMappingOrigin is 'embedded', in which case, the RP is extracted from the group address in question.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.32,PIM-STD-MIB::pimInvalidRegisterMsgsRcvd,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of invalid PIM Register messages that have been received by this device. A PIM Register message is invalid if either o the destination address of the Register message does not match the Group to RP mapping on this device, or o this device believes the group address to be within an SSM address range, but this Register implies ASM usage. These conditions can occur transiently while RP mapping changes propagate through the network. If this counter is incremented repeatedly over several minutes, then there is a persisting configuration error that requires correction. The active Group to RP mapping on this device is specified by the object pimGroupMappingPimMode. If there is no such mapping, then the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent. The RP address contained in the invalid Register is pimInvalidRegisterRp. Multicast data carried by invalid Register messages is discarded. The discarded data is from a source directly connected to pimInvalidRegisterOrigin, and is addressed to pimInvalidRegisterGroup. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted.

A PIM Join/Prune message is invalid if either o the Group to RP mapping specified by this message does not match the Group to RP mapping on this device, or o this device believes the group address to be within an SSM address range, but this Join/Prune (*,G) or (S,G,rpt) implies ASM usage. These conditions can occur transiently while RP mapping changes propagate through the network. If this counter is incremented repeatedly over several minutes, then there is a persisting configuration error that requires correction. The active Group to RP mapping on this device is specified by the object pimGroupMappingPimMode. If there is no such mapping, then the object pimGroupMappingPimMode is absent. The RP address contained in the invalid Join/Prune is pimInvalidJoinPruneRp. Invalid Join/Prune messages are discarded. This may result in loss of multicast data affecting listeners downstream of pimInvalidJoinPruneOrigin, for multicast data addressed to pimInvalidJoinPruneGroup. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.39,PIM-STD-MIB::pimInvalidJoinPruneAddressType,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type stored in pimInvalidJoinPruneOrigin, pimInvalidJoinPruneGroup, and pimInvalidJoinPruneRp.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.44,PIM-STD-MIB::pimRPMappingChangeCount,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of changes to active RP mappings on this device. Information about active RP mappings is available in pimGroupMappingTable. Only changes to active mappings cause this counter to be incremented. That is, changes that modify the pimGroupMappingEntry with the highest precedence for a group (lowest value of pimGroupMappingPrecedence). Such changes may result from manual configuration of this device, or from automatic RP mapping discovery methods including the PIM Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.45,PIM-STD-MIB::pimInterfaceElectionNotificationPeriod,Unsigned32,read-write,,current,,The minimum time that must elapse between pimInterfaceElection notifications originated by this router.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.46,PIM-STD-MIB::pimInterfaceElectionWinCount,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this device has been elected DR or DF on any interface. Elections occur frequently on newly-active interfaces, as triggered Hellos establish adjacencies. This counter is not incremented for elections on an interface until the first periodic Hello has been sent. If this router is the DR or DF at the time of sending the first periodic Hello after interface activation, then this counter is incremented (once) at that time. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, for example, when the device is rebooted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.157.1.47,PIM-STD-MIB::pimRefreshInterval,Unsigned32,read-write,,current,,The interval between successive State Refresh messages sent by an Originator.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.5,ENTERASYS-RADIUS-AUTH-CLIENT-ENCRYPT-MIB::etsysRadiusAuthClientEncryptMIB,,,,,,The Enterasys Networks Proprietary MIB module for entities  implementing the client side of the Remote Access Dialin  User Service (RADIUS) authentication protocol (RFC2865). N O T I C E Use of this MIB in any product requires the approval of the Office of the CTO, Enterasys Networks, Inc.  Permission to use this MIB will not be granted for  products in which SNMPv3 is now, or will soon be, implemented. Permission to use this MIB in products that are never scheduled to implement SNMPv3 will be  granted on a case-by-case basis, depending on what  other suitable, secure means of RADIUS client  configuration are available in the product. ------------------ The standard RADIUS Authentication Client MIB (RFC2618) does not have any writable objects, and is missing key  objects needed for configuration.  Use of this MIB requires encryption/decryption for security during transmission, using SNMPv1. Therefore, there are two  separate processes needed to use this MIB.   1) The standard processes for SNMP gets and sets. 2) The encoding/encryption or decryption/decoding of objects.  The encryption/decryption algorithm, as presented herein, is taken from the RADIUS protocol, and is the method specified for encryption of Tunnel-Password Attributes in RFC 2868. For a detailed discussion of the encoding/decoding and  encryption/decryption of applicable objects, refer to the  definition of RadiusEncryptionString defined in the Textual  Conventions section of this MIB.  Note that the encryption/decryption method makes use of an  agreed-upon Secret and an Authenticator which are shared between the RADIUS Client SNMP interface and the management entity implementing the MIB.  The reason that the shared secret and authenticator are  algorithmically derived in the RADIUS Client / SNMP Agent and in the SNMP Management Station is to permit plug-'n-play remote installation, configuration and management of the device.  An object is included to allow remote management of the  Authenticator portion of the encryption key. It is suggested  that this value be changed by the network administrator after initial configuration of the system.  On receipt, the process is reversed to yield the plain-text  String.

If a port has an active policy and the policy's  etsysPolicyProfilePortVidStatus is set to enabled(1), the  etsysPolicyProfilePortVid will be applied to all untagged  frames arriving on the port that do not match any of the  policy classification rules.  Note that the 802.1Q PVID will still exist from a management view but will NEVER be applied to traffic  arriving on a port that has an active policy and enabled  etsysPolicyProfilePortVid defined, since policy is applied to traffic arriving on the port prior to the assignment of a VLAN using the 802.1Q PVID. The behavior of an enabled etsysPolicyProfilePortVid on  any associated port SHALL be identical to the behavior of  the dot1qPvid upon that port.  Note that two special, otherwise illegal, values of the etsysPolicyProfilePortVid are used in defining the default forwarding actions, to be used in conjunction with policy classification rules, and do not result in packet tagging:  0 Indicates that the default forwarding action  is to drop all packets that do not match an  explicit rule.  4095 Indicates that the default forwarding action is to forward any packets not matching any explicit rules.

If a port has an active policy and the policy's  etsysPolicyProfilePriorityStatus is set to enabled(1), the  etsysPolicyProfilePriority will be applied to all packets  arriving on the port that do not match any of the policy  classification rules.  Note that dot1dPortDefaultUserPriority will still exist  from a management view but will NEVER be applied to traffic  arriving on a port that has an active policy and enabled  etsysPolicyProfilePriority defined, since policy is applied to traffic arriving on the port prior to the assignment of a priority using dot1dPortDefaultUserPriority.

If policyProfile(1) is selected, then the filter-id will be used, if vlanTunnelAttribute(2) is  selected, then the vlan-tunnel-attribute will be used (and the policy-map will be applied, if present). A value of  vlanTunnelAttributeWithPolicyProfile(3) indicates that both  attributes should be applied, in the following manner: the  policyProfile should be enforced, with the exception of the  etsysPolicyProfilePortVid (if present), the returned  vlan-tunnel-attribute will be used in its place. In this case,  the policy-map will be ignored (as the policyProfile was  explicitly assigned). VLAN classification rules will still be applied, as defined by the assigned policyProfile. Modifications of this value will not effect the current status of any users currently authenticated. The new state will be  applied to new, successful authentications. The current status of current authentication may be modified through the  individual agents or through the ENTERASYS-MULTI-AUTH-MIB, if  supported.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.6.12.2,ENTERASYS-POLICY-PROFILE-MIB::etsysPolicyRFC3580MapLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the etsysPolicyRFC3580MapTable was last modified.

If set to True, then the etsysPolicyRFC3580MapTable will be put into the default state (no mappings will exist). A set to  False is not valid and MUST fail.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.6.12.4,ENTERASYS-POLICY-PROFILE-MIB::etsysPolicyRFC3580MapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table containing VLAN ID to policy mappings. A policy is a group of classification rules which may be applied on a  per user basis, to ports or to stations.

Entries within this table MUST be considered non-volatile and MUST be maintained across  entity resets.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.6.12.4.1.1,ENTERASYS-POLICY-PROFILE-MIB::etsysPolicyRFC3580MapVlanId,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The VlanIndex which will map to the policy profile specified  by the etsysPolicyRFC3580MapPolicyIndex of this row. This will be used to map the VLAN returned by value from the Tunnel- Private-Group-ID RADIUS attribute.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.6.12.4.1.2,ENTERASYS-POLICY-PROFILE-MIB::etsysPolicyRFC3580MapPolicyIndex,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The index of a Policy Profle as defined in the  etsysPolicyProfileTable.  A value of 0 indicates that the row is functionally non- operational (no mapping exists). Devices which support the  ENTERASYS-VLAN-AUTHORIZATION-MIB, and for which the value of etsysVlanAuthorizationEnable is Enabled and the value of etsysVlanAuthorizationStatus is Enabled on the port referenced by the authorization request, should then use the VlanIndex provisioned (e.g. from the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID RADIUS  attribute) as defined by RFC3580, otherwise, the device should treat the result as if no matching Policy Profile had been  found (e.g. as a simple success). In the case where a Policy Profile is already being applied to the referenced  station, but no mapping exists, the device MUST treat the  Tunnel-Private-Group-ID as an override to the  etsysPolicyProfilePortVid defined by that profile (any matched classification rules which explicit provision a VLAN MUST still override both the etsysPolicyProfilePortVid and the  Tunnel-Private-Group-ID.)  A non-zero value of this object indicates that the VlanIndex provisioned (e.g. from the Tunnel-Private-Group-ID RADIUS  attribute) should be mapped to a Policy Profile as defined in  the etsysPolicyProfileTable, and that policy applied as if  the Policy name had been provisioned instead (e.g, in the Filter-ID RADIUS attribute). If the mapping references a non-existent row of the etsysPolicyProfileTable, or the  referenced row has a etsysPolicyProfileRowStatus value other than Active, the device MUST behave as if the mapping did not exist (apply the vlan-tunnel-attribute). The  etsysPolicyRFC3580MapInvalidMapping MUST then be incremented.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.6.12.5,ENTERASYS-POLICY-PROFILE-MIB::etsysPolicyRFC3580MapInvalidMapping,Counter32,read-only,,current,,Increments to indicate the number of times the device has detected an invalid/unknown EtsysPolicyRFC3580MapEntry  (i.e. one that references an in-active or non-existent etsysPolicyProfile).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaMIB,,,,,,This MIB module provides the ability to configure the  Port Web Authentication (PWA) component in a switch. PWA provides a way of authenticating a user on a  switch port before allowing the user general access to the network. Only the essential protocols and services required by the authentication process are allowed on the segment between the end-station and the switch port. All other traffic will be discarded. When a user is in the unauthenticated state, any traffic generated by the end-station will not go beyond the switch port that they are  connected to. The PWA/login process from the user standpoint is simple. The user makes a request via their favorite web browser for the 'secureharbour' web page. Depending  upon the authenticated state of the port, a login page is provided so that the user can enter their username and password, or a logout page is presented to the user. When they submit their login page, the switch will then  authenticate them via a preconfigured radius server.  If the login is successful, then the port that the end-station is connected to will be turned on and full network access will be granted according to the  users port configuration on the switch. This MIB module also provides status about the PWA component and statistics about all current users who are logged into the switch.

This object is a DNS/WINS name and is considered to be bound to the etsysPwaSystemAuthIPAddress.  This object must not contain the protocol portion of the URL  nor any directory or filenames. Changing this objects value changes the default name of the http server located at the local switch. An administrator can change this objects value to whatever name is appropriate for their network.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.3,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthBanner,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The banner that will be displayed on the web login page  of the Port Web Authentication Control in a System. This banner is a courtesy introduction to the network, which the user sees on the login page. P.O. Box 5005 Rochester, NH 03866-5005 USA 603 337-94\ }
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.4,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemPwaNameServicesEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),The enable state of the name services application.  Enabling this object turns on the Domain Name Service (DNS) and the Windows Internet Naming Services (WINS) clients. These clients will resolve only requests for the etsysPwaSystemAuthHostName. Disabling this object would require users in the network to know and use the etsysPwaSystemAuthIPAddress of this system.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.5,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthIPAddressType,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),This object has been deprecated. Refer to etsysPwaSystemAuthIPAddress for the reason. The textual convention for InetAddressType states that this object must be registered immediately before the InetAddress that it defines. etsysPwaSystemAuthInetAddressType MUST be used for all future implementations of this MIB.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.6,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthIPAddress,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,This object has been deprecated due to an incorrect initial implementation of this MIB. This object was originally an InetAddress but some versions of the E7 firmware implemented it as an IpAddress. The syntax of this object was changed to allow management of the existing products. The etsysPwaSystemAuthInetAddress object MUST be used for all future implementations of this MIB.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.7,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthProtocol,INTEGER,read-write,,current,chap(1):pap(2),The authentication protocol used for this switch module. When set to a chap(1), the authentication scheme used will  be the 'PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol  (CHAP)', when set to a pap(2), the scheme will be  'Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)'.  When using the CHAP protocol, the username and password  utilize the CHAP protocol method of encryption to encrypt the users password in the http transmission of the submitted form on the segment between the end-station and the switch port. The PAP protocol is less secure than CHAP and does not provide any encryption on the segment between the  end-station the switch port. The username and password go over this segment in the http transmission of the  submitted form in plain text format.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.8,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthDomain,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The domain name for which this module resides in.

This value MUST be used if the value of the corresponding InetAddress object is a zero-length string. It may also be used to indicate an IP address which is not in one of the formats defined below. ipv4(1) An IPv4 address as defined by the InetAddressIPv4 textual convention. ipv6(2) An IPv6 address as defined by the InetAddressIPv6 textual convention.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.10,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthInetAddress,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The IP address bound to the etsysPwaSystemAuthHostName. The format of this object is defined in the etsysPwaSystemAuthInetAddressType object. This address MUST be supplied for authentication to work. This is a globally unique address and must be the same value configured into every authenticating switch in the domain. Each switch terminates any IP traffic destined to this etsysPwaSystemAuthInetAddress. If the port is in either  promiscousAuto(4) or auto(2) mode, described in the  etsysPwaControlledPortControl object, then the local  switch in question responds to http requests with a login  page. If the port is in any other mode, then all traffic  destined for etsysPwaSystemAuthInetAddress is discarded. Please note that neither the etsysPwaSystemAuthHostName  object nor this object refer to any specific machine in the network. These objects are always relative to the connection between an end station and a switch. Traffic destined for this IP is never seen over interswitch links.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.11,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemAuthEnhancedMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),The enable state of the PWA enhanced mode. When this feature is enabled users on unauthenticated ports will be presented the login page on their initial web access. The etsysPwaControlledPortControl object MUST be set to auto(2) for this feature to function correctly. If etsysPwaControlledPortControl is not set to auto(2), or if this feature is disabled, users must enter the value of etsysPwaSystemAuthHostName in order to get the login page.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.12,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaLogoDisplayStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),When this object is set to enabled, the secureharbour logo will be displayed on the PWA login web pages. When it is set to disabled, the logo will not be displayed.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.13,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemGuestUsername,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The username that the Guest Networking feature will use to authenticate users that do not override this value in the login page.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.14,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemGuestPassword,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The password that the Guest Networking feature will use to authenticate users that do not override the guest username. On a read this object will always return an empty string.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.15,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemGuestPasswordValid,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),true(1) - indicates that etsysPwaGuestPassword was last set with some value other than the empty string. false(2) - indicates that etsysPwaGuestPassword has never been set, or was last set to the empty string.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.16,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemGuestNetworkingStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,disabled(1):authNone(2):authRadius(3),Guest Networking is a feature that allows a user to get default policy access to the network without having to know a username or password. When this feature is not disabled(1), the username on the login page will be populated with the value from the object etsysPwaGuestUsername and the password will be mask out with asterisks. The password in the login page should never be populated with the value from etsysPwaGuestPassword. When Guest Networking is enabled, and a user submits a request for authentication, and the username is the same as the value from etsysPwaGuestUsername, PWA will use the value from etsysPwaGuestPassword as the password for authentication. When this object is set to disabled(1), Guest Networking will be unavailable.  When set to authNone(2) Guest Networking will be enabled and it will not authenticate the guest user using any authentication method. Once the user submits the login page with the username that matches the value from etsysPwaGuestUsername, the default policy of that port will become the active policy. When set to authRadius(3) Guest Networking will be enabled and it will authenticate the guest user using RADIUS authentication Upon a successful authentication from RADIUS, this port will apply the policy returned from RADIUS to that port.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.1.17,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaSystemEnhancedModeRefreshTime,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This is the value that is displayed on the PWA login success page as the redirect time.   If a user, using PWA enhanced mode, enters a URL of 'http://enterasys.com' prior to being presented with the PWA login page and then successfully authenticates into the network they would be presented with a login success page that displays 'Welcome to the Network. Completing network connections. You will be redirected to http://enterasys.com in approximately 30 seconds'.  An end-station that is utilizing the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as a means of obtaining an IP address will take some time to transition from the temporary IP address issued by PWA, as part of the authentication process, to the official IP address issued by the network.  etsysPwaSystemEnhancedModeRefreshTime provides a configurable time period for the end-stations on a given switch to complete the process of obtaining their official IP addresses and to begin using them. The default value of 30 seconds has been shown to be adequate in most environments. In some networks this time period may need to be longer, and in other networks it could be shorter. In networks that only use static IP addresses a time period on the order of 5 to 10 seconds may be sufficient. A period of less than 5 seconds is not recommended as there is a slight delay after a successful login before the switch transitions the port to forwarding.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.2.1.1.2,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaInitializePort,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),The initialization control for this ifIndex. This object can be used to unauthenticate a user on a port or to return the port to its initial default state due to some unknown condition. Setting this attribute to true(1) causes the Port to be initialized. The attribute value reverts to false(2) once initialization has completed. Initializing a port returns the etsysPwaAuthPwaState to disconnected(1) and if the etsysPwaControlledPortControl setting is either promiscousAuto(4) or auto(2), and the etsysPwaAuthPwaState was authenticated(3), then the current session is terminated, and the user is forced off the network.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.2.1.1.3,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaAuthQuietPeriod,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The value, in seconds, of the quietPeriod constant  currently in use by the Port Web Authenticator state machine. After the user attempts unsuccessfully to login  a number of times equal to the etsysPwaAuthMaxReq constant, then the ifIndex is locked for a time period equal to the  value of this MIB entry. In the initial released version of this MIB this object was an Unsigned32. The initial implementation on the E7 returned an Integer32. The syntax of this object was changed to reflect the existing product in the field. All future implementations of this object should return an Integer32.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.2.1.1.4,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaAuthMaxReq,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The value of the maxReq constant currently in use by the  Port Web Authenticator state machine. This represents the  maximum number of failed retry attempts before preventing  any further attempts for a time period equal to the value of etsysPwaAuthQuietPeriod. In the initial released version of this MIB this object was an Unsigned32. The initial implementation on the E7 returned an Integer32. The syntax of this object was changed to reflect the existing product in the field. All future implementations of this object should return an Integer32.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.8.2.1.1.5,ENTERASYS-PWA-MIB::etsysPwaControlledPortControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,forceUnauthorized(1):auto(2):forceAuthorized(3):promiscousAuto(4),The authentication method of the ifIndex.  A value of forceUnauthorized(1) indicates that the  port is always unauthenticated. When set to this value the ifindex is essentially disabled. A value of auto(2) indicates that the ifindex will authenticate users using PWA process. In this mode  the switch will provide all the services the  end-station will need to complete the login. These  services include a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  (DHCP) server, a Windows Internet Naming Server (WINS),  and a Domain Name Service (DNS) Server. A value of forceAuthorized(3) indicates the port is always  authorized. When set to this value, the ifindex will always be authenticated.  When set to promiscousAuto(4) the services that are  required to complete the network login are not provided by the switch. These services must be provided on a  back-end network that the end-station can communicate with. These services might be specific to the particular Operating System of the end-station and could also include the same services as provided in auto mode.

When the value of this object is 'active' none of the other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. Setting this object to the 'active' state from the 'notInService' state will cause the requested configuration operation to be initiated. Once the requested configuration operation has completed, successfully or otherwise, this leaf will be set to the 'notInService' state by the managed entity. Setting this object to any other valid state from the 'active' state SHOULD cause the managed entity to cancel the requested operation at its earliest most rational opportunity. Setting this object to the 'active' state from the 'active' state SHOULD NOT have any affect. Conceptual rows that have been in the 'notInService' state for more than a device specific time period MAY be destroyed by the managed entity.

If the selected port/Authenticator PAE does not support the EAPOL-Key feature (e.g., because radio keys are not applicable to Ethernet ports), this object's value will be FALSE and attempts to write TRUE will fail. Normally, if radio keys are present, the manager enters them into the access point through some manual process. The manager or the users may also need to configure the keys into each laptop (access points can distribute the keys automatically to 802.1x EAP-TLS clients). However laptops get keys, the keys remain static until somebody goes to the trouble of changing them. If the keys stay unchanged for long periods, this can make it easier for a determined attacker to launch a cryptographic attack. When rapid rekeying is enabled, an access point ignores its manually-set keys. It generates pseudo-random keys on a periodic basis, using IEEE 802.1x key distribution to deliver the keys to new and current clients. Do not enable rapid rekeying unless ALL of your clients support IEEE 802.1x and an authentication method (e.g., EAP-TLS) that supports key distribution. Before enabling rapid rekeying, make sure that you have set 'dot1xAuthKeyTxEnabled' to TRUE. Changing the keys without telling any of the clients about the changes is not a very useful mode of operation.

This table's existence is due to the realization that devices may not have the resources to  keep all of this data for all the authenticated stations;  however, there is a need when debugging a network for these statistics. This compromise solution allows the network administrator to pick which stations to collect data for. If the maximum number of stations this device can collect data for is equal to the maximum number of stations the device can authenticate than this table has no effect or  meaning. If the maximum number of stations this device can collect data for is 0 then this table has no effect or meaning.  Please note: even though a station may be placed into the watch table, the statistics and diagnostic information that is acquired is ultimately determined by the device's capability to  acquire that data. The statistics, diagnostics, and session  statistics tables all have a read only object that allow the  network administrator to determine what information the device can acquire.

This MIB includes encrypted variants of selected objects from the IEEE 802.1x MIB and the Enterasys 802.1x Extensions MIB. ------------------ N O T I C E Use of this MIB in any product requires the approval of the Office of the CTO, Enterasys Networks, Inc.  Permission to use this MIB will not be granted for  products in which SNMPv3 is now, or will soon be, implemented. Permission to use this MIB in products that are never scheduled to implement SNMPv3 will be  granted on a case-by-case basis, depending on what  other suitable, secure means of configuration are available in the product. ------------------ The following is a discussion of the encoding/decoding and encryption/decryption methods that must be used to extract data from an encrypted OCTET STRING. (These methods are the same as for the Enterasys Networks encrypted RADIUS Client MIB.)  The encryption/decryption methods make use of an agreed-upon Secret and an Authenticator shared between the SNMP network management system and the entity that implements the MIB. The encryption/decryption algorithm, as presented herein, is taken from the RADIUS protocol, and is the method specified for encryption of Tunnel-Password Attributes in RFC 2868. To permit plug-and-play remote installation, configuration, and management of the device, the device will algorithmically derive the initial shared secret and the initial authenticator. For security reasons, the network manager should change the authenticator portion of the management encryption key after initial configuration. The methods available for doing this are implementation-specific and subject to change. All read-write and write-only access objects except the table index are encoded into fields in an OCTET STRING. Octet String Before encryption, a 'native' object must be encoded into a formatted Octet String. After decryption, the Octet String must be decoded to obtain the 'native' object. 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Type | Length | Salt | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | String ... +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Type The data type of the non-encrypted 'native' data: 1 = Integer32 2 = OCTET STRING  Length The length in octets of the native object sub-field of the Octet String, exclusive of any optional padding. Note that the Integrity Check sub-fields (CRC, OID-tail, Time Stamp, Source IP Address) are not included in this length value, but since the IC sub-fields are always present and are of fixed length, there is no impediment to proper packet parsing. Salt The Salt field is two octets in length and is used to ensure the uniqueness of the encryption key used to encrypt each object. The most significant bit (leftmost) of the Salt field MUST be set (1). The contents of each Salt field in a given SNMP packet must be unique. String 0 1 2 3

This MIB includes encrypted variants of selected objects from the Enterasys 802.1x Rapid Rekeying MIB. ------------------ N O T I C E Use of this MIB in any product requires the approval of the Office of the CTO, Enterasys Networks, Inc.  Permission to use this MIB will not be granted for  products in which SNMPv3 is now, or will soon be, implemented. Permission to use this MIB in products that are never scheduled to implement SNMPv3 will be  granted on a case-by-case basis, depending on what  other suitable, secure means of configuration are available in the product. ------------------ The following is a discussion of the encoding/decoding and encryption/decryption methods that must be used to extract data from an encrypted OCTET STRING. (These methods are the same as for the Enterasys Networks encrypted RADIUS Client MIB.)  The encryption/decryption methods make use of an agreed-upon Secret and an Authenticator shared between the SNMP network management system and the entity that implements the MIB. The encryption/decryption algorithm, as presented herein, is taken from the RADIUS protocol, and is the method specified for encryption of Tunnel-Password Attributes in RFC 2868. To permit plug-and-play remote installation, configuration, and management of the device, the device will algorithmically derive the initial shared secret and the initial authenticator. For security reasons, the network manager should change the authenticator portion of the management encryption key after initial configuration. The methods available for doing this are implementation-specific and subject to change. (On the RoamAbout AccessPoint 2000, the encrypted RADIUS client MIB contains an authenticator object used for both that MIB and this one.) All read-write and write-only access objects except the table index are encoded into fields in an OCTET STRING. Octet String Before encryption, the 'native' objects must be encoded into a formatted Octet String. After decryption, the Octet String must be decoded to obtain the 'native' objects. 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | Type | Length | Salt | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ | String ... +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  Type The data type of the non-encrypted 'native' data: 1 = Integer32 2 = OCTET STRING  Length The length in octets of the native object sub-field of the Octet String, exclusive of any optional padding. Note that the Integrity Check sub-fields (CRC, OID-tail, Time Stamp, Source IP Address) are not included in this length value, but since the IC sub-fields are always present and are of fixed length, there is no impediment to proper packet parsing.

Determines how an access point selects radio encryption keys. If the selected port does not support the EAPOL-Key feature (e.g., because radio keys are not applicable to Ethernet ports), this object will have a value of FALSE and attempts to write TRUE will fail. Normally, if radio keys are present, the manager enters them into the access point through some manual process. The manager or the users may also need to configure the keys into each laptop (access points can distribute the keys automatically to 802.1x EAP-TLS clients). However laptops get keys, the keys remain static until somebody goes to the trouble of changing them. If the keys stay unchanged for long periods, this can make it easier for a determined attacker to launch a cryptographic attack. When rapid rekeying is enabled, an access point ignores its manually-set keys. It generates pseudo-random keys on a periodic basis, using IEEE 802.1x key distribution to deliver the keys to new and current clients. Do not enable rapid rekeying unless ALL of your clients support IEEE 802.1x and an authentication method (e.g., EAP-TLS) that supports key distribution. Before enabling rapid rekeying, make sure that you have set 'dot1xAuthKeyTxEnabled' to TRUE. Changing the keys without telling any of the clients about the changes is not a very useful mode of operation. The data type is 1, Integer32.

Setting this object to pushButtonSave(2) will cause SNMP sets of persistent objects to be buffered in volatile memory until the configuration is explicitly saved to persistent memory, either through the CLI or by setting the etsysSnmpPersistenceWrite object to save(2). Setting this object to timeDelayedSave(3) will cause SNMP sets of persistent objects to be buffered in volatile memory until certain implementation dependent time conditions are met. Once these conditions are met the configuration is saved to persistent memory. Setting this object to a mode that is not supported on that particular implementation leads to an inconsistent value error. On an SNMP get operation this object will return the current persistent storage mode of operation.

Any configuration changes made through SNMP will become part of the start-up configuration if and when another management interface saves the current configuration to persistent storage. Setting this object to save(2) while the value of the etsysSnmpPersistenceMode object is NOT pushButtonSave(2) MAY lead to an inconsistent value error. Setting this object to save(2) while the value of the etsysSnmpPersistenceStatus object is savingChanges(3) leads to an inconsistent value error. Setting this object to nop(1) always succeeds and has no effect. On an SNMP get operation this object will return nop(1).

This MIB was designed to be used for authentication using source MAC addresses received in traffic on ports under control of MAC-authentication. The security afforded by this approach is neither the primary concern nor intent of this MIB. Rather, this MIB provides a convenient method of associating policy with MAC addresses and applying that policy when the MAC address appears on a pre-approved port in the network. The term MAC-Authentication is used because an authentication backend mechanism is used to allow the MAC onto the network, as well as provide authorization information to the switch.

Rules 1. When creating a RADIUS Accounting Client, it  is up to the management station to determine a  suitable etsysRadiusAcctClientServerIndex. To facilitate interoperability, agents should not  put any restrictions on the  etsysRadiusAcctClientServerIndex beyond the  obvious ones that it be valid and unused. 2. Before a new row can become 'active', values must be supplied for the columnar objects etsysRadiusAcctClientClientServerAddress, and etsysRadiusAcctClientServerSecret. 3. The value of etsysRadiusAcctClientServerStatus must be set to 'notInService' in order to modify a writable object in the same conceptual row. 4. etsysRadiusAcctClientServer entries whose  status is 'notReady' or 'notInService' will  not be used for Accounting.

When this object is true(1), the etsysWPAConfigMulticastCipher must be WEP-40 or WEP-104 (a.k.a. 128-bit WEP). Using WEP Group keys and letting legacy clients associate may weaken security. To minimize this, 1. Enable legacy associations only on radios that support Pairwise keys. 2. Enable frequent Group key rekeying. With TKIP and AES, there's much less threat of key cracking than with WEP, so the default is 'once in a blue moon'. With WEP, you need to think more in terms of Rapid Rekeying. Access points implementing this feature are under no obligation to support non-802.1X clients. For instance, an access point might use one-time dynamic WEP keys when WPA Group key rotation is disabled. Static WEP clients would not know these keys.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.32.1.1.1.23,ENTERASYS-WIFI-PROTECTED-ACCESS-MIB::etsysWPAConfigRekeyPairwiseWEP,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object applies when WPA is enabled (dot11PrivacyInvoked, etsysWPAConfigEnabled) and management has chosen to allow a mix of WPA and non-WPA clients (etsysWPAConfigAllowLegacyClients). It specifies whether the access point should tumble Pairwise WEP keys belonging to non-WPA clients. The access point uses Group key rotation as a trigger for Pairwise WEP key tumbling; if you want the latter, be sure to configure the former. See also: etsysDot1xRekeyPairwise.

Packets on interfaces that are configured to detect End Points, via the etsysConvEndPointProtocolConfigTable, that are defined in this table are inspected to determine if a Convergence End Point exists on that interface. Rules applying to Convergence End Point types that are configured for detection are evaluated according to the following: 1. If etsysConvEndPointDetectionProtocol does not have any bits set, this indicates that the port based detection should not be performed, proceed to step 2. Otherwise the value in etsysConvEndPointDetectionProtocol is evaluated against the protocol field in the IP header, if it is of a, or the, type specified then the destination port must be between the values of etsysConvEndPointDetectionPortLow and etsysConvEndPointDetectionPortHigh, inclusive. 2. If the etsysConvEndPointDetectionAddr is null, this  indicates that no detection address check should be  performed, consider the End Point detected. Otherwise the value the of etsysConvEndPointDetectionAddr will be masked with the value of etsysConvEndPointDetectionAddrMask, via a bitwise AND operation, and this value will be compared with the destination IP address that has also been masked with the value of etsysConvEndPointDetectionAddrMask, via a bitwise AND operation, if they are equal then consider the End Point detected. If there are no rows in this table that are in the active state then the following pseudo entries describe the behavior of the IP based Convergence End Point detection. EndPointType siemens Protocol { { udp, tcp } } PortLow 4060 PortHigh 4060 AddrType unknown Addr '' AddrMaskType unknown AddrMask '' EndPointType h323 Protocol { { udp, tcp } } PortLow 1718 PortHigh 1720 AddrType ipv4 Addr '224.0.1.41' AddrMaskType ipv4 AddrMask '255.255.255.255' EndPointType sip Protocol { { udp, tcp } } PortLow 5060 PortHigh 5060 AddrType ipv4 Addr '224.0.1.75' AddrMaskType ipv4 AddrMask '255.255.255.255' If one or more entries in this table are active the active entries will define the IP based detection behavior in its entirety.

If OSPF is being deactivated, grace LSAs are sent out to inform neighboring routers that we wish to undergo a hitless restart. If OSPF is being activated, we will attempt to restart hitlessly, then set this field to 'false'. Therefore this field needs to be explicitly set to 'true' each time planned hitless restart is required. This object is persistent and when written the entity SHOULD save the change to non-volatile storage.

Note that etsysOspfExtDoGraceHitless has a higher priority than this object. Therefore if both etsysOspfExtDoGraceHitless and this object are both set to 'true' on activation, OSPF will assume it is undergoing a planned hitless restart. If only this object is 'true', then OSPF will attempt an unplanned hitless restart, and send out grace LSAs on activation.

This is the maximum packet size in bytes for packets sent over the network interface. This size excludes link layer headers but includes IP headers and higher-level headers. Normally, OSPF limits sent PDUs (protocol data units) to less than or equal to this size. However, if OSPF cannot construct a valid PDU smaller than or equal to this size, then it will send the smallest valid PDU and assume that the IP stack will fragment the packet.

If this object is set to 'false', then a dynamically created entry in the ospfNbrTable will remain with state 'down' when the adjacency is lost. Such entries can be deleted manually by setting ospfNbrStatus to 'destroy'. If this object is set to 'true', then dynamically created entries in the ospfNbrTable will be deleted automatically when the adjacency goes down.

Setting this object to adminStatusUp turns on the RIP protocol, while setting it to adminStatusDown turns off the RIP protocol. When the object is set to adminStatusUp, it triggers the RIP process to begin normal operation by populating its routing table and sending/receiving routing updates. Setting this object to adminStatusDown turns off the RIP  protocol. This causes the etsysRip2ExtOperStatus object to change its state to operStatusGoingDown. This has the effect of removing all of the RIP routes from the RIB.

Changing the state of the etsysRip2ExtAdminStatus object may effect the state of this object. If etsysRip2ExtAdminStatus is set to adminStatusDown, this object's status is changed to operStatusGoingDown. Once the RIP process has finished cleaning up its routing table and freeing its resources, the status is changed to operStatusDown. If etsysRip2ExtAdminStatus is set to adminStatusUp, this object's status is changed to operStatusGoingUp. After RIP allocates its resources and begins operation, the status of this object changes to operStatusUp. If there are problems acquiring the resources needed to operate the RIP protocol, the status changes to operStatusActFailed.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationBaseBranch,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.1,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysMaxActivationKeyRow,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The largest value that the agent supports for the index object etsysActivationKeyRow.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains activation keys for optional features.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2.1,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyEntry,,not-accessible,etsysActivationKeyRow,current,,Each valid conceptual row contains basic information about one product activation key. Only those rows for which the etsysActivationKeyStatus is active(1) may enable features. Note that it is possible for an active(1) row to contain a well-formatted, internally-consistent key that has expired. A managed system is under no obligation to enable features in response to the presence of expired keys.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2.1.1,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyRow,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies a row in the product key table. Agents are not required to accept arbitrary indices -- they may limit indices to numbers in the range (1 - N), where N is defined as the maximum number of activation keys that can usefully be supported on a product.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2.1.2,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationLicenseString,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A place for human-readable administrative information associated with this activation key, such as a product serial number or a demo key's registration date. Some key formats may require entry of 'License String' values provided by the vendor. Agents may enforce the following rule with respect to such paired-key rows: ------------------------------------------------------- This object MUST be set before etsysActivationKeyStatus can become active(1), and MAY NOT be modified while etsysActivationKeyStatus is active(1). -------------------------------------------------------
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2.1.3,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyValue,OCTET,read-create,,current,,An activation key. The activation key must be coded as a string of printable characters. Spaces and hyphens are reserved punctuation characters. They may be used freely on input and output, and do not form part of the key value. (The agent is not required to preserve these or other non-essential aspects of the key formatting.) The key must conform to one of the meta-formats defined in this DESCRIPTION. These meta-formats are subject to change. Agents should validate activation keys at Set time. An agent may reject even a valid key if it is inapplicable to the managed device. This object MUST be set before etsysActivationKeyStatus can become active(1), and MAY NOT be modified while etsysActivationKeyStatus is active(1). ======================================================= Standard activation keys have the following format: <FormatCode> <OpaqueKey> The <FormatCode> is encoded as four hexadecimal digits, and identifies the format of the <OpaqueKey>. The <OpaqueKey> may be encoded in any fashion the agent likes, within the constraints mentioned earlier in this DESCRIPTION. ======================================================= A platform may accept keys of the format <Keyword> [Qualifiers] provided that there is no possibility of confusion with standard activation keys. This format is best suited to non-secret demo keys that are intended for a wide audience ('everyone reading the user manual'). ======================================================= Backwards compatibility example Task : Configure an existing RoamAbout AccessPoint 2000 P-MP activation key, using this MIB. <OpaqueKey> : XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (existing key) <FormatCode> : 0001 You enter : 0001-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX =======================================================
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2.1.4,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyType,INTEGER,read-only,,current,noKey(1):unknownKeyType(2):productKey(3):demoKey(4),Derived from the activation key. Identifies the type of key (product key vs. demonstration key). Identification of existing demonstration keys may not be 100% accurate.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.2.1.5,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),Supports creation, deletion, and activation of rows in the etsysActivationKeyTable. An instance of this variable may become active(1) only when there is a corresponding etsysActivationKeyValue. For some key formats, the etsysActivationLicenseString may need to be set to a matching vendor-supplied value. Note that a row with an active(1) status may contain a demo key that has expired, and that no longer provides access to any features.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.3,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyFeatureTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table indicates which optional feature or features each activation key enables. Rows only appear in this table for 'etsysActivationKeyValue' instances that contain recognizable key values.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.3.1,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyFeatureEntry,,not-accessible,etsysActivationKeyRow:etsysActivationKeyFeature,current,,Each valid conceptual row indicates the existence of a known mapping between an activation key and an optional feature.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.3.1.1,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyFeature,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,dot1xAuthentication(1):pointToMultipoint(2),Identifies one of the optional product features enabled by an activation key in the etsysActivationKeyTable.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5624.1.2.99999.1.1.3.1.2,ENTERASYS-ACTIVATION-MIB::etsysActivationKeyRestrictions,OCTET,read-only,,current,,If the activation key associated with this row is a demo key, this MIB object may contain a human-readable string describing the key's restrictions, expiration conditions, and/or status. A demo key that enables several features could, at least theoretically, have different conditions for each. Platforms may automatically enforce expirations, but are not guaranteed to do so. It is ultimately the system manager's responsibility to clean up expired keys. For a key that has no restrictions, this object's value may consist of the empty string, or of whitespace.
