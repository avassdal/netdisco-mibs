.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The interval at which LLDP frames are transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent. The default value for lldpMessageTxInterval object is 30 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 30 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The time-to-live value expressed as a multiple of the lldpMessageTxInterval object. The actual time-to-live value used in LLDP frames, transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent, can be expressed by the following formula: TTL = min(65535, (lldpMessageTxInterval * lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier)) For example, if the value of lldpMessageTxInterval is '30', and the value of lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier is '4', then the value '120' is encoded in the TTL field in the LLDP header. The default value for lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier object is 4. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 4 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpReinitDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpReinitDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) from when lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object of a particular port becomes 'disabled' until re-initialization will be attempted. The default value for lldpReintDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpTxDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpTxDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) between successive LLDP frame transmissions  initiated by value/status changes in the LLDP local systems MIB. The recommended value for the lldpTxDelay is set by the following formula: 1 <= lldpTxDelay <= (0.25 * lldpMessageTxInterval) The default value for lldpTxDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.5,LLDP-MIB::lldpNotificationInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object controls the transmission of LLDP notifications. the agent must not generate more than one lldpRemTablesChange notification-event in the indicated period, where a 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional changes in lldpRemoteSystemsData object groups occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should periodically check the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime to detect any missed lldpRemTablesChange notification-events, e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss. If notification transmission is enabled for particular ports, the suggested default throttling period is 5 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 5 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls LLDP frame transmission on individual ports.

If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txOnly(1)', then LLDP agent will transmit LLDP frames on this port and it will not store any information about the remote systems connected.  If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'rxOnly(2)', then the LLDP agent will receive, but it will not transmit LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txAndRx(3)', then the LLDP agent will transmit and receive LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'disabled(4)', then LLDP agent will not transmit or receive LLDP frames on this port. If there is remote systems information which is received on this port and stored in other tables, before the port's lldpPortConfigAdminStatus becomes disabled, then the information will naturally age out. DEFVAL { txAndRx }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),The lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable controls, on a per port basis, whether or not notifications from the agent are enabled.

Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a TLV type associated with a specific optional TLV. It should be noted that the organizationally-specific TLVs are excluded from the lldpTLVsTxEnable bitmap.  LLDP Organization Specific Information Extension MIBs should have similar configuration object to control transmission of their organizationally defined TLVs. The bit 'portDesc(0)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'Port Description TLV'. The bit 'sysName(1)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Name TLV'. The bit 'sysDesc(2)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Description TLV'. The bit 'sysCap(3)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Capabilities TLV'. There is no bit reserved for the management address TLV type since transmission of management address TLVs are controlled by another object, lldpConfigManAddrTable. The default value for lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable object is empty set, which means no enumerated values are set. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { { } }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls selection of LLDP management address TLV instances to be transmitted on individual ports.

This configuration object augments the lldpLocManAddrEntry, therefore it is only present along with the management address instance contained in the associated lldpLocManAddrEntry entry. Each active lldpConfigManAddrEntry must be restored from non-volatile and re-created (along with the corresponding lldpLocManAddrEntry) after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable,OCTET,read-write,,current,,A set of ports that are identified by a PortList, in which each port is represented as a bit. The corresponding local system management address instance will be transmitted on the member ports of the lldpManAddrPortsTxEnable.  The default value for lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable object is empty binary string, which means no ports are specified for advertising indicated management address instance. DEFVAL { 0 }

An NMS can use this object to reduce polling of the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesInserts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been inserted into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. The complete set of information received from a particular MSAP should be inserted into related tables. If partial information cannot be inserted for a reason such as lack of resources, all of the complete set of information should be removed. This counter should be incremented only once after the complete set of information is successfully recorded in all related tables. Any failures during inserting information set which result in deletion of previously inserted information should not trigger any changes in lldpStatsRemTablesInserts since the insert is not completed yet or or in lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes, since the deletion would only be a partial deletion. If the failure was the result of lack of resources, the lldpStatsRemTablesDrops counter should be incremented once.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely deleted from all related tables. Partial deletions, such as deletion of rows associated with a particular MSAP from some tables, but not from all tables are not allowed, thus should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDrops,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP could not be entered into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because of insufficient resources.

This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely invalidated (aged out) from all related tables. Partial aging, similar to deletion case, is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.

The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.

An unrecognized TLV is referred to as the TLV whose type value is in the range of reserved TLV types (000 1001 - 111 1110) in Table 9.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AB-2005. An unrecognized TLV may be a basic management TLV from a later LLDP version.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The counter that represents the number of age-outs that occurred on a given port. An age-out is the number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because the information timeliness interval has expired. This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except that the counter is on a per port basis. This enables NMS to poll tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems on the indicated port only. This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage. When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to 'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with the same port should reset to 0. The agent should also flush all remote system information associated with the same port. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from all related tables on a particular port. Partial aging is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.4.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one or more rows per physical network connection known to this agent. The agent may wish to ensure that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for the same local port. The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote systems information updates from an LLDP agent: 1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved. NMS polls periodically the values of the following objects: a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports. 2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and sends out notifications to a list of notification destinations. 3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new values of objects listed in step 1.  Periodically, NMS should poll the object lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything has changed since the last poll. if something has changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed, then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter with the last-polled time value. This request will return new objects or objects whose values are updated since the last poll. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed, then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and compare the new values with previously recorded ones. For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to retrieve objects associated with those ports from table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.) lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes and lldpStatsRemTablesDrops objects are provided for informational purposes.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11,IF-MIB::ifInUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDelivers,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of input datagrams successfully delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutRequests,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of IP datagrams which local IP user-protocols (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission. Note that this counter does not include any datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of seconds which received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of failures detected by the IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragOKs,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.18,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Don't Fragment flag was set.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcasts addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteDest,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,The destination IP address of this route. An entry with a value of 0.0.0.0 is considered a default route. Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsEntry,,not-accessible,etherStatsIndex,current,,A collection of statistics kept for a particular Ethernet interface. As an example, an instance of the etherStatsPkts object might be named etherStatsPkts.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies this etherStats entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::etherStatsMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that had a length (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherStatsUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherStatsFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of history control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

Each instance of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry will be deleted by the agent if this historyControlEntry is not equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,etherHistoryIndex:etherHistorySampleIndex,current,,An historical sample of Ethernet statistics on a particular Ethernet interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3,RMON-MIB::alarm,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.

For example, an instance of the hostControlTableSize object might be named hostControlTableSize.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostControlLastDeleteTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last entry was deleted from the portion of the hostTable associated with this hostControlEntry. If no deletions have occurred, this value shall be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this hostControl entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated entries in the hostTable, hostTimeTable, and the hostTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2,RMON-MIB::hostTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of host entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1,RMON-MIB::hostEntry,,not-accessible,hostIndex:hostAddress,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular host that has been discovered on an interface of this device. For example, an instance of the hostOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostOutBroadcastPkts.1.6.8.0.32.27.3.176
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that defines the relative ordering of the creation time of hosts captured for a particular hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostInPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostOutPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets, including bad packets, transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::hostOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), including those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::hostOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of bad packets transmitted by this address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::hostOutBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to the broadcast address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::hostOutMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to a multicast address since this host was added to the hostTable.

This collection includes the relative ordering of the creation time of this object. For example, an instance of the hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts.1.687
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostTimeAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTimeCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostTime table among those entries associated with the same hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostTimeIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hostControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTopNHostIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The host table for which a top N report will be prepared on behalf of this entry. The host table identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the same host table as identified by the same value of hostIndex. This object may not be modified if the associated hostTopNStatus object is equal to valid(1).

The new value is used as the requested duration of this report, which is loaded into the associated hostTopNDuration object. When this object is set to a non-zero value, any associated hostTopNEntries shall be made inaccessible by the monitor. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. During this time, all associated hostTopNEntries shall remain inaccessible. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the hostTopNTable. Thus, the hostTopN table needs to be created only at the end of the collection interval. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostTopNDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval, or if this report is currently being collected, the number of seconds that this report is being collected during this sampling interval. When the associated hostTopNTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the hostTopNTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this hostTopNControlEntry. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostTopNRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of hosts requested for the top N table.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the filter table. Each such entry defines one filter that is to be applied to every packet received on an interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset from the beginning of each packet where a match of packet data will be attempted. This offset is measured from the point in the physical layer packet after the framing bits, if any. For example, in an Ethernet frame, this point is at the beginning of the destination MAC address. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::channelIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the channel table. Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::channelIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the interface on this remote network monitoring device to which the associated filters are applied to allow data into this channel. The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel. DEFVAL { off }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems. DEFVAL { eventReady }

The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible. DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1. DEFVAL { -1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::captureBufferIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the captureBuffer table associated with a particular bufferControlEntry. This index will start at 1 and increase by one for each new packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex. Should this value reach 2147483647, the next packet added with the same captureBufferControlIndex shall cause this value to wrap around to 1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.

These indexes are assigned beginning with 1 and increase by one with each new log entry. The association between values of logIndex and logEntries is fixed for the lifetime of each logEntry. The agent may choose to delete the oldest instances of logEntry as required because of lack of memory. It is an implementation-specific matter as to when this deletion may occur.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11,RMON2-MIB::protocolDir,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last created or the values of the physical address changed.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.

This object may not be modified if the associated nlMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1). If this value is less than or equal to 2, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNTable associated with this object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixDSOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type transmitted from the source address to the destination address since this entry was added to the alMatrixDSTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), excluding octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixDSCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the entry has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters that control the creation of a report of the top N matrix entries according to a selected metric.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlEntry,,not-accessible,alMatrixTopNControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the alMatrixTopNControlTable. An example of the indexing of this table is alMatrixTopNControlDuration.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alMatrixTopNControlTable. Each such entry defines one topN report prepared for one interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlMatrixIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The alMatrix[SD/DS] table for which a topN report will be prepared on behalf of this entry. The alMatrix[SD/DS] table is identified by the value of the hlMatrixControlIndex for that table - that value is used here to identify the particular table. This object may not be modified if the associated alMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlRateBase,INTEGER,read-create,,current,alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts(1):alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets(2):alMatrixTopNAllPkts(3):alMatrixTopNAllOctets(4):alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts(5):alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets(6):alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts(7):alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets(8),This object controls which alMatrix[SD/DS] entry that the alMatrixTopNEntries are sorted by, which view of the matrix table that will be used, as well as which table the results will be reported in. The values alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts, alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets, alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets cause collection only from protocols that have no child protocols that are counted. The values alMatrixTopNAllPkts, alMatrixTopNAllOctets, alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets cause collection from all alMatrix entries. This object may not be modified if the associated alMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated alMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the alMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the alMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGeneratedReports,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of reports that have been generated by this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.6,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this alMatrixTopNControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries requested for this report.

DEFVAL { 150 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of alMatrixTopNPktRate or alMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.10,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNEntry,,not-accessible,alMatrixTopNControlIndex:alMatrixTopNIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the alMatrixTopNTable. The alMatrixTopNControlIndex value in the index identifies the alMatrixTopNControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. An example of the indexing of this table is alMatrixTopNPktRate.3.10
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alMatrixTopNTable among those in the same report. This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The protocolDirLocalIndex of the network-layer protocol of this entry's network address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNSourceAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the source host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNDestAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the destination host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNAppProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The type of the protocol counted by this matrix entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.6,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNPktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDPkts object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReversePktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSPkts object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDOctets object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReverseOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSOctets object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDOctets object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNOctetRate, and not on the value of this object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a group of user-defined MIB objects to be sampled periodically (called a bucket-group). For example, an instance of usrHistoryControlInterval might be named usrHistoryControlInterval.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlObjects,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of MIB objects to be collected in the portion of usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. This object may not be modified if the associated instance of usrHistoryControlStatus is equal to active(1).

When this object is created or modified, the probe should set usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to '0.0.0.0' when no IP address has been specified.

If downloadToRAM(3) is specified, the new image is copied to RAM only (the old image remains unaltered in the flash EPROM). If downloadToPROM(2) is specified, the new image is written to the flash EPROM memory after its checksum has been verified to be correct. When the download process is completed, the device will warm boot to restart the newly loaded application. When the device is not downloading, this object will have a value of notDownloading(1). This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.

This table is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least-significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.6.1,P-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dTpPortOverflowEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dTpPort,current,,The most significant bits of statistics counters for a high- capacity interface of a transparent bridge.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

Changes to a bit in this object affect the per-port, per-VLAN Registrar control for Registration Fixed for the relevant GVRP state machine on each port. A port may not be added in this set if it is already a member of the set of ports in dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts. The default value of this object is a string of zeros of appropriate length, indicating not fixed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.4.3.1.3,Q-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The set of ports that are prohibited by management from being included in the egress list for this VLAN.

This will report values >=4096 if a new Local VLAN may be created or else the value 0 if this is not possible. A row creation operation in this table for an entry with a local VlanIndex value may fail if the current value of this object is not used as the index. Even if the value read is used, there is no guarantee that it will still be the valid index when the create operation is attempted; another manager may have already got in during the intervening time interval. In this case, dot1qNextFreeLocalVlanIndex should be re-read and the creation re-tried with the new value. This value will automatically change when the current value is used to create a new row.

The value enabled(1) indicates that GVRP is enabled on this port, as long as dot1qGvrpStatus is also enabled for this device. When disabled(2) but dot1qGvrpStatus is still enabled for the device, GVRP is disabled on this port: any GVRP packets received will be silently discarded, and no GVRP registrations will be propagated from other ports. This object affects all GVRP Applicant and Registrar state machines on this port. A transition from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will cause a reset of all GVRP state machines on this port. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system. DEFVAL { enabled }

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrGroupChange,,,,,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** In a system containing a single managed repeater, this notification is sent when a change occurs in the group structure of the repeater. This occurs only when a group is logically or physically removed from or added to a repeater. The varBind list contains the identifier of the group that was removed or added. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrGroupChange traps for the same group so that there is at least a five-second gap between traps of this type. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a trap means sending to all configured recipients.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrResetEvent,,,,,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** In a system containing a single managed repeater-unit, the rptrResetEvent notification conveys information related to the operational status of the repeater. This trap is sent on completion of a repeater reset action. A repeater reset action is defined as an a transition to the START state of Fig 9-2 in section 9 [IEEE 802.3 Std], when triggered by a management command (e.g., an SNMP Set on the rptrReset object). The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrResetEvent traps so that there is at least a five-second gap between traps of this type. When traps are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a trap means sending to all configured recipients.) The rptrResetEvent trap is not sent when the agent restarts and sends an SNMP coldStart or warmStart trap. However, it is recommended that a repeater agent send the rptrOperStatus object as an optional object with its coldStart and warmStart trap PDUs. The rptrOperStatus object must be included in the varbind list sent with this trap. The agent may optionally include the rptrHealthText object as well.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.0.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrInfoHealth,,,,,,In a system containing multiple managed repeaters, the rptrInfoHealth notification conveys information related to the operational status of a repeater. It is sent either when the value of rptrInfoOperStatus changes, or upon completion of a non-disruptive test. The agent must throttle the generation of consecutive rptrInfoHealth notifications for the same repeater so that there is at least a five-second gap between notifications of this type. When notifications are throttled, they are dropped, not queued for sending at a future time. (Note that 'generating' a notification means sending to all configured recipients.)

Within each managed repeater, the groups are uniquely numbered in the range from 1 to rptrGroupCapacity. Some groups may not be present in the repeater, in which case the actual number of groups present will be less than rptrGroupCapacity. The number of groups present will never be greater than rptrGroupCapacity. Note: In practice, this will generally be the number of field-replaceable units (i.e., modules, cards, or boards) that can fit in the physical repeater enclosure, and the group numbers will correspond to numbers marked on the physical enclosure.

The rptrHealthText object may be consulted for more specific information about the state of the repeater's health. In the case of multiple kinds of failures (e.g., repeater failure and port failure), the value of this attribute shall reflect the highest priority failure in the following order, listed highest priority first: rptrFailure(3) groupFailure(4) portFailure(5) generalFailure(6).

Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect. The agent will always return the value noReset(1) when this object is read. After receiving a request to set this variable to reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset for a short period. For example, the implementor may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow the SNMP response to be transmitted. In any event, the SNMP response must be transmitted. This action does not reset the management counters defined in this document nor does it affect the portAdminStatus parameters. Included in this action is the execution of a disruptive Self-Test with the following characteristics: a) The nature of the tests is not specified. b) The test resets the repeater but without affecting management information about the repeater. c) The test does not inject packets onto any segment. d) Packets received during the test may or may not be transferred. e) The test does not interfere with management functions. After performing this self-test, the agent will update the repeater health information (including rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText), and send a rptrHealth trap.

After performing this test, the agent will update the repeater health information (including rptrOperStatus and rptrHealthText) and send a rptrHealth trap. Note that this definition allows returning an 'okay' result after doing a trivial test. Setting this object to noSelfTest(1) has no effect. The agent will always return the value noSelfTest(1) when this object is read.

This value should include the full name and version identification of the group's hardware type and indicate how the group is differentiated from other types of groups in the repeater. Plug-in Module, Rev A' or 'Barney Rubble 10BASE-T 4-port SIMM socket Version 2.1' are examples of valid group descriptions. It is mandatory that this only contain printable ASCII characters.

This value may be allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides a straight-forward and unambiguous means for determining what kind of group is being managed. For example, this object could take the value 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.2.14 if vendor 'Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, and had assigned the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.2.14 to its 'Wilma Flintstone 6-Port FOIRL Plug-in Module.'

A status of notPresent(4) indicates that the group is temporarily or permanently physically and/or logically not a part of the repeater. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent effectively removes notPresent entries from the table. A status of operational(2) indicates that the group is functioning, and a status of malfunctioning(3) indicates that the group is malfunctioning in some way.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.2.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrGroupLastOperStatusChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,deprecated,,********* THIS OBJECT IS DEPRECATED ********** An object that contains the value of sysUpTime at the time when the last of the following occurred: 1) the agent cold- or warm-started; 2) the row for the group was created (such as when the group was added to the system); or 3) the value of rptrGroupOperStatus for the group changed. A value of zero indicates that the group's operational status has not changed since the agent last restarted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.2.1.1.6,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrGroupPortCapacity,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The rptrGroupPortCapacity is the number of ports that can be contained within the group. Valid range is 1-2147483647. Within each group, the ports are uniquely numbered in the range from 1 to rptrGroupPortCapacity. Some ports may not be present in the system, in which case the actual number of ports present will be less than the value of rptrGroupPortCapacity. The number of ports present in the group will never be greater than the value of rptrGroupPortCapacity. Note: In practice, this will generally be the number of ports on a module, card, or board, and the port numbers will correspond to numbers marked on the physical embodiment.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortGroupIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,This object identifies the group containing the port for which this entry contains information.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,This object identifies the port within the group for which this entry contains information. This identifies the port independently from the repeater it may be attached to. The numbering scheme for ports is implementation specific; however, this value can never be greater than rptrGroupPortCapacity for the associated group.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Setting this object to disabled(2) disables the port. A disabled port neither transmits nor receives. Once disabled, a port must be explicitly enabled to restore operation. A port which is disabled when power is lost or when a reset is exerted shall remain disabled when normal operation resumes. The admin status takes precedence over auto- partition and functionally operates between the auto-partition mechanism and the AUI/PMA. Setting this object to enabled(1) enables the port and exerts a BEGIN on the port's auto-partition state machine. (In effect, when a port is disabled, the value of rptrPortAutoPartitionState for that port is frozen until the port is next enabled. When the port becomes enabled, the rptrPortAutoPartitionState becomes notAutoPartitioned(1), regardless of its pre-disabling state.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortAutoPartitionState,INTEGER,read-only,,current,notAutoPartitioned(1):autoPartitioned(2),The autoPartitionState flag indicates whether the port is currently partitioned by the repeater's auto-partition protection. The conditions that cause port partitioning are specified in partition state machine in Sections 9 and 27 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]. They are not differentiated here.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,operational(1):notOperational(2):notPresent(3),This object indicates the port's operational status. The notPresent(3) status indicates the port is physically removed (note this may or may not be possible depending on the type of port.) The operational(1) status indicates that the port is enabled (see rptrPortAdminStatus) and working, even though it might be auto-partitioned (see rptrPortAutoPartitionState). If this object has the value operational(1) and rptrPortAdminStatus is set to disabled(2), it is expected that this object's value will soon change to notOperational(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.3.1.1.6,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrPortRptrId,Integer32,read-only,,current,,This object identifies the repeater to which this port belongs. The repeater identified by a particular value of this object is the same as that identified by the same value of rptrInfoId. A value of zero indicates that this port currently is not a member of any repeater.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.1.4.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrInfoReset,INTEGER,read-write,,current,noReset(1):reset(2),Setting this object to reset(2) causes a transition to the START state of Fig 9-2 in section 9 [IEEE 802.3 Std] for a 10Mb/s repeater, and to the START state of Fig 27-2 in section 27 of that standard for a 100Mb/s repeater. Setting this object to noReset(1) has no effect. The agent will always return the value noReset(1) when this object is read. After receiving a request to set this variable to reset(2), the agent is allowed to delay the reset for a short period. For example, the implementor may choose to delay the reset long enough to allow the SNMP response to be transmitted. In any event, the SNMP response must be transmitted.

Regular retrieval of the information in this table provides a means of tracking the performance and health of the networked devices attached to this group's ports. The counters in this table are redundant in the sense that they are the summations of information already available through other objects. However, these sums provide a considerable optimization of network management traffic over the otherwise necessary retrieval of the individual counters included in each sum. Note: Group-level counters are deprecated in this MIB. It is recommended that management applications instead use the repeater-level counters contained in the rptrMonTable.

A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter in a 10Mb/s repeater is 58 minutes. For ports receiving traffic at a maximum rate in a 100Mb/s repeater, this counter can roll over in less than 6 minutes. Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information a management station is advised to also poll the rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets object, or to use the 64-bit counter defined by rptrMonitorPortHCReadableOctets instead of the two 32-bit counters.

ShortEventMaxTime has tolerances included to provide for circuit losses between a conformance test point at the AUI and the measurement point within the state machine. Notes: ShortEvents may indicate externally generated noise hits which will cause the repeater to transmit Runts to its other ports, or propagate a collision (which may be late) back to the transmitting DTE and damaged frames to the rest of the network. Implementors may wish to consider selecting the ShortEventMaxTime towards the lower end of the allowed tolerance range to accommodate bit losses suffered through physical channel devices not budgeted for within this standard. The significance of this attribute is different in 10 and 100 Mb/s collision domains. Clause 9 repeaters perform fragment extension of short events which would be counted as runts on the interconnect ports of other repeaters. Clause 27 repeaters do not perform fragment extension. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.9,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortRunts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent on this port that meets one of the following two conditions. Only one test need be made. a) The ActivityDuration is greater than ShortEventMaxTime and less than ValidPacketMinTime and the CollisionEvent signal is deasserted. b) The OctetCount is less than 64, the ActivityDuration is greater than ShortEventMaxTime and the CollisionEvent signal is deasserted. ValidPacketMinTime is greater than or equal to 552 bit times and less than 565 bit times. An event whose length is greater than 74 bit times but less than 82 bit times shall increment either the shortEvents counter or the runts counter but not both. A CarrierEvent greater than or equal to 552 bit times but less than 565 bit times may or may not be counted as a runt. ValidPacketMinTime has tolerances included to provide for circuit losses between a conformance test point at the AUI and the measurement point within the state machine. Runts usually indicate collision fragments, a normal network event. In certain situations associated with large diameter networks a percentage of collision fragments may exceed ValidPacketMinTime. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.10,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 repeater, this counter is incremented by one for any CarrierEvent signal on any port for which the CollisionEvent signal on this port is asserted. For a clause 27 repeater port the counter increments on entering the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]). A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.11,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortLateEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent on this port in which the CollIn(X) variable transitions to the value SQE (Ref: 9.6.6.2, IEEE 802.3 Std) while the ActivityDuration is greater than the LateEventThreshold. For a clause 27 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one on entering the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8) while the ActivityDuration is greater than the LateEvent- Threshold. Such a CarrierEvent is counted twice, as both a collision and as a lateEvent. The LateEventThreshold is greater than 480 bit times and less than 565 bit times. LateEventThreshold has tolerances included to permit an implementation to build a single threshold to serve as both the LateEventThreshold and ValidPacketMinTime threshold. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 81 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.12,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortVeryLongEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one for each CarrierEvent whose ActivityDuration is greater than the MAU Jabber Lockup Protection timer TW3 (Ref: 9.6.1 & 9.6.5, IEEE 802.3 Std). For a clause 27 repeater port, this counter is incremented by one on entry to the Rx Jabber state of the receiver timer state diagram (fig 27-7). Other counters may be incremented as appropriate. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.13,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortDataRateMismatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each frame received by this port that meets all of the conditions required by only one of the following two measurement methods: Measurement method A: 1) The CollisionEvent signal is not asserted (10Mb/s operation) or the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]) has not been entered (100Mb/s operation). 2) The ActivityDuration is greater than ValidPacketMinTime. 3) The frequency (data rate) is detectably mismatched from the local transmit frequency. Measurement method B: 1) The CollisionEvent signal is not asserted (10Mb/s operation) or the Collision Count Increment state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]) has not been entered (100Mb/s operation). 2) The OctetCount is greater than 63. 3) The frequency (data rate) is detectably mismatched from the local transmit frequency. The exact degree of mismatch is vendor specific and is to be defined by the vendor for conformance testing. When this event occurs, other counters whose increment conditions were satisfied may or may not also be incremented, at the implementor's discretion. Whether or not the repeater was able to maintain data integrity is beyond the scope of this standard. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.14,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortAutoPartitions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each time the repeater has automatically partitioned this port. The conditions that cause a clause 9 repeater port to partition are specified in the partition state diagram in clause 9 of [IEEE 802.3 Std]. They are not differentiated here. A clause 27 repeater port partitions on entry to the Partition Wait state of the partition state diagram (fig 27-8 in [IEEE 802.3 Std]). A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.15,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortTotalErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of errors which have occurred on this port. This counter is the summation of the values of other error counters (for the same port), namely: rptrMonitorPortFCSErrors, rptrMonitorPortAlignmentErrors, rptrMonitorPortFrameTooLongs, rptrMonitorPortShortEvents, rptrMonitorPortLateEvents, rptrMonitorPortVeryLongEvents, rptrMonitorPortDataRateMismatches, and rptrMonitorPortSymbolErrors. This counter is redundant in the sense that it is the summation of information already available through other objects. However, it is included specifically because the regular retrieval of this object as a means of tracking the health of a port provides a considerable optimization of network management traffic over the otherwise necessary retrieval of the summed counters. Note that rptrMonitorPortRunts is not included in this total; this is because runts usually indicate collision fragments, a normal network event. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.1.1.16,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last of the following occurred: 1) the agent cold- or warm-started; 2) the row for the port was created (such as when a device or module was added to the system); or 3) any condition that would cause one of the counters for the row to experience a discontinuity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitor100PortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Table of additional performance and error statistics for 100Mb/s ports, above and beyond those parameters that apply to both 10 and 100Mbps ports. Entries exist only for ports attached to 100Mbps repeaters. The columnar object rptrMonitorPortLastChange is used to indicate possible discontinuities of counter type columnar objects in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitor100PortEntry,,not-accessible,rptrMonitorPortGroupIndex:rptrMonitorPortIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing performance and error statistics for a single 100Mb/s port.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortIsolates,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one each time that the repeater port automatically isolates as a consequence of false carrier events. The conditions which cause a port to automatically isolate are defined by the transition from the False Carrier state to the Link Unstable state of the carrier integrity state diagram (figure 27-9) [IEEE 802.3 Standard]. Note: Isolates do not affect the value of the PortOperStatus object. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortSymbolErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one each time when valid length packet was received at the port and there was at least one occurrence of an invalid data symbol. This can increment only once per valid carrier event. A collision presence at any port of the repeater containing port N, will not cause this attribute to increment. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 7.4 hours at 100Mb/s.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object is the number of octets contained in valid frames that have been received on this port, modulo 2**32. That is, it contains the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit octets counter, of which the lower 32 bits are contained in the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets object. This two-counter mechanism is provided for those network management protocols that do not support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMP V1) and are used to manage a repeater type of 100Mb/s. Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s. If this object is implemented, it must be according to the definition in the first paragraph of this description; that is, the value of this object MUST be a valid count. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.3.2.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonitorPortHCReadableOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,This object is the number of octets contained in valid frames that have been received on this port. This counter is incremented by OctetCount for each frame received on this port which has been determined to be a readable frame (i.e., including FCS octets but excluding framing bits and dribble bits). This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. This counter is a 64-bit version of rptrMonitor- PortReadableOctets. It should be used by network management protocols which suppport 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMPv2). Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s. If this object is implemented, it must be according to the definition in the first paragraph of this description; that is, the value of this object MUST be a valid count. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of information about each non-trivial repeater. The number of entries in this table is the same as the number of entries in the rptrInfoTable. The columnar object rptrInfoLastChange is used to indicate possible discontinuities of counter type columnar objects in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonEntry,,not-accessible,rptrInfoId,current,,An entry in the table, containing information about a single non-trivial repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.1.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonTxCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For a clause 9 (10Mb/s) repeater, this counter is incremented every time the repeater state machine enters the TRANSMIT COLLISION state from any state other than ONE PORT LEFT (Ref: Fig 9-2 [IEEE 802.3 Std]). For a clause 27 repeater, this counter is incremented every time the repeater core state diagram enters the Jam state as a result of Activity(ALL) > 1 (fig 27-2 [IEEE 802.3 Std]). The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 16 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater and 1.6 hours in a 100Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.1.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonTotalFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of frames of valid frame length that have been received on the ports in this repeater and for which the FCSError and CollisionEvent signals were not asserted. If an implementation can not obtain a count of frames as seen by the repeater itself, this counter may be implemented as the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableFrames counters for all of the ports in the repeater. This statistic provides one of the parameters necessary for obtaining the packet error rate. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 80 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonTotalErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of errors which have occurred on all of the ports in this repeater. The errors included in this count are the same as those listed for the rptrMonitorPortTotalErrors counter. If an implementation can not obtain a count of these errors as seen by the repeater itself, this counter may be implemented as the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortTotalErrors counters for all of the ports in the repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonTotalOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets contained in the valid frames that have been received on the ports in this group. If an implementation can not obtain a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself, this counter may be the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets counters for all of the ports in the group. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter in a 10Mb/s repeater is 58 minutes divided by the number of ports in the repeater. For 100Mb/s repeaters processing traffic at a maximum rate, this counter can roll over in less than 6 minutes divided by the number of ports in the repeater. Since that amount of time could be less than a management station's poll cycle time, in order to avoid a loss of information a management station is advised to also poll the rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets object, or to use the 64-bit counter defined by rptrMonHCTotalOctets instead of the two 32-bit counters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMon100Table,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of additional information about each 100Mb/s repeater, augmenting the entries in the rptrMonTable. Entries exist in this table only for 100Mb/s repeaters. The columnar object rptrInfoLastChange is used to indicate possible discontinuities of counter type columnar objects in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMon100Entry,,not-accessible,rptrInfoId,current,,An entry in the table, containing information about a single 100Mbps repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets contained in the valid frames that have been received on the ports in this repeater, modulo 2**32. That is, it contains the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit counter, of which the lower 32 bits are contained in the rptrMonTotalOctets object. If an implementation can not obtain a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself, the 64-bit value may be the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets counters combined with the corresponding rptrMonitorPortUpper32Octets counters for all of the ports in the repeater. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred within the repeater. This two-counter mechanism is provided for those network management protocols that do not support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMP V1) and are used to manage a repeater type of 100Mb/s. Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s. However, systems with mixed 10 and 100Mb/s ports may implement this object across all ports, including 10Mb/s. If this object is implemented, it must be according to the definition in the first paragraph of this description; that is, the value of this object MUST be a valid count.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.2.4.2.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrMonHCTotalOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets contained in the valid frames that have been received on the ports in this group. If a implementation can not obtain a count of octets as seen by the repeater itself, this counter may be the summation of the values of the rptrMonitorPortReadableOctets counters for all of the ports in the group. This statistic provides an indicator of the total data transferred. This counter is a 64-bit (high-capacity) version of rptrMonUpper32TotalOctets and rptrMonTotalOctets. It should be used by network management protocols which support 64-bit counters (e.g. SNMPv2). Conformance clauses for this MIB are defined such that implementation of this object is not required in a system which does not support 100Mb/s.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrTrackRptrInfo,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one entry per repeater in the system. It defines objects which allow a network management application to instruct an agent to watch for a given MAC address and report which port it was seen on. Only one address search can be in progress on each repeater at any one time. Before starting an address search, a management application should obtain 'ownership' of the entry in rptrAddrSearchTable for the repeater that is to perform the search. This is accomplished with the rptrAddrSearchLock and rptrAddrSearchStatus as follows: try_again: get(rptrAddrSearchLock, rptrAddrSearchStatus) while (rptrAddrSearchStatus != notInUse) { /* Loop waiting for objects to be available*/ short delay get(rptrAddrSearchLock, rptrAddrSearchStatus) } /* Try to claim map objects */ lock_value = rptrAddrSearchLock if ( set(rptrAddrSearchLock = lock_value, rptrAddrSearchStatus = inUse, rptrAddrSearchOwner = 'my-IP-address) == FAILURE) /* Another manager got the lock */ goto try_again /* I have the lock */ set (rptrAddrSearchAddress = <search target>) wait for rptrAddrSearchState to change from none if (rptrAddrSearchState == single) get (rptrAddrSearchGroup, rptrAddrSearchPort) /* release the lock, making sure not to overwrite anyone else's lock */ set (rptrAddrSearchLock = lock_value+1, rptrAddrSearchStatus = notInUse, rptrAddrSearchOwner = '') A management station first retrieves the values of the appropriate instances of the rptrAddrSearchLock and rptrAddrSearchStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of rptrAddrSearchStatus is 'notInUse'. The management station then tries to set the same instance of the rptrAddrSearchLock object to the value it just retrieved, the same instance of the rptrAddrSearchStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchOwner to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds, then the management station has obtained ownership of the rptrAddrSearchEntry, and the value of rptrAddrSearchLock is incremented by the agent (as per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the rptrAddrSearchEntry. Once ownership is obtained, the management station can proceed with the search operation. Note that the agent will reset rptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse' if it has been in the 'inUse' state for an abnormally long period of time, to prevent a misbehaving manager from permanently locking the entry. It is suggested that this timeout period be between one and five minutes. When the management station has completed its search operation, it should free the entry by setting the instance of the rptrAddrSearchLock object to the previous value + 1, the instance of the rptrAddrSearchStatus to 'notInUse', and the instance of rptrAddrSearchOwner to a zero length string. This is done to prevent overwriting another station's lock.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchEntry,,not-accessible,rptrInfoId,current,,An entry containing objects for invoking an address search on a repeater.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object is used to indicate that some management station is currently using this rptrAddrSearchEntry. Cooperating managers should set this object to 'notInUse' when they are finished using this entry. The agent will automatically set the value of this object to 'notInUse' if it has been set to 'inUse' for an unusually long period of time.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1.3,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchAddress,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is used to search for a specified MAC address. When this object is set, an address search begins. This automatically sets the corresponding instance of the rptrAddrSearchState object to 'none' and the corresponding instances of the rptrAddrSearchGroup and rptrAddrSearchPort objects to 0. When a valid frame is received by this repeater with a source MAC address which matches the current value of rptrAddrSearchAddress, the agent will update the corresponding instances of rptrAddrSearchState, rptrAddrSearchGroup and rptrAddrSearchPort to reflect the current status of the search, and the group and port on which the frame was seen.

This object is initialized to 'none' when the corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchAddress is set. If the agent detects the address on exactly one port, it will set this object to 'single', and set the corresponding instances of rptrAddrSearchGroup and rptrAddrSearchPort to reflect the group and port on which the address was heard. If the agent detects the address on more than one port, it will set this object to 'multiple'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.1.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrSearchGroup,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The group from which an error-free frame whose source address is equal to the corresponding instance of rptrAddrSearchAddress has been received.

This object has been deprecated because its value is undefined when no frames have been observed on this port. The replacement object is rptrAddrTrackNewLastSrcAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrTrackSourceAddrChanges,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This counter is incremented by one for each time that the rptrAddrTrackLastSourceAddress attribute for this port has changed. This may indicate whether a link is connected to a single DTE or another multi-user segment. A discontinuity may occur in the value when the value of object rptrMonitorPortLastChange changes. The approximate minimum time for rollover of this counter is 81 hours in a 10Mb/s repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.3.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrAddrTrackNewLastSrcAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object is the SourceAddress of the last readable frame (i.e., counted by rptrMonitorPortReadableFrames) received by this port.

This value indicates to the maximum number of entries in the rptrExtAddrTrackTable relative to this port. If this object has the value of 1, the agent implements only the LastSourceAddress mechanism described by RFC 1368 or RFC 1516.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.3.3.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrExtAddrTrackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to extend the address tracking table (i.e., rptrAddrTrackTable) with a list of source MAC addresses that were recently received on each port. The number of ports is the same as the number of entries in table rptrPortTable. The number of entries in this table depends on the agent/repeater implementation and the number of different addresses received on each port. The first entry for each port contains the same MAC address that is given by the rptrAddrTrackNewLastSrcAddress for that port. Entries in this table for a particular port are retained when that port is switched from one repeater to another. The ordering of MAC addresses listed for a particular port is implementation dependent.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortRepeaterId,Integer32,read-create,,current,,Identifies the repeater for which a top N report will be prepared (see rptrInfoId). If the value of this object is positive, only ports assigned to this repeater will be used to form the list in which to order the Top N table. If this value is zero, all ports will be eligible for inclusion on the list. The value of this object may not be modified if the associated rptrTopNPortRowStatus object is equal to active(1). If, for a particular row in this table, the repeater specified by the value of this object goes away (is removed from the rptrInfoTable) while the associated rptrTopNPortRowStatus object is equal to active(1), the row in this table is preserved by the agent but the value of rptrTopNPortRowStatus is changed to notInService(2), and the agent may time out the row if appropriate. If the specified repeater comes back (reappears in the rptrInfoTable) before the row has been timed out, the management station must set the value of the rptrTopNPortRowStatus object back to active(1) if desired (the agent doesn't do this automatically).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.4,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report, which is loaded into the associated rptrTopNPortDuration object. When this object is set to a non-zero value, any associated rptrTopNPortEntries shall be made inaccessible by the agent. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. During this time, all associated rptrTopNPortEntries shall remain inaccessible. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the rptrTopNPortTable. Thus, the rptrTopNPort table needs to be created only at the end of the collection interval. If the value of this object is set to zero while the associated report is running, the running report is aborted and no associated rptrTopNPortEntries are created. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval, or if this report is currently being collected, the number of seconds that this report is being collected during this sampling interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.7,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of repeater ports in the top N table. When the associated rptrTopNPortRequestedSize object is created or modified, the agent should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The agent must not lower this value except as a result of a set to the associated rptrTopNPortRequestedSize object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.8,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this top N report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated rptrTopNPortTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report. If the report has not yet been started, the value of this object is zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.1.1.9,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.4.3.2,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::rptrTopNPortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of reports for the top `N' ports based on setting of associated control table entries. The maximum number of entries depends on the number of entries in table rptrTopNPortControlTable and the value of object rptrTopNPortGrantedSize for each entry. For each entry in the rptrTopNPortControlTable, repeater ports with the highest value of rptrTopNPortRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of that rate until there is no more room or until there are no more ports.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. Increasing values of rptrTopNPortIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of rptrTopNPortRate until index N is assigned to the entry with the lowest value of rptrTopNPortRate or there are no more rptrTopNPortEntries. No ports are included in a report where their value of rptrTopNPortRate would be zero.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.22.5,SNMP-REPEATER-MIB::snmpRptrMod,,,,,,Management information for 802.3 repeaters. The following references are used throughout this MIB module: [IEEE 802.3 Std] refers to IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3 Information processing systems - Local area networks - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications (1993). [IEEE 802.3 Mgt] refers to IEEE 802.3u-1995, '10 Mb/s & 100 Mb/s Management, Section 30,' Supplement to ANSI/IEEE 802.3. The following terms are used throughout this MIB module. For complete formal definitions, the IEEE 802.3 standards should be consulted wherever possible: System - A managed entity compliant with this MIB, and incorporating at least one managed 802.3 repeater. Chassis - An enclosure for one managed repeater, part of a managed repeater, or several managed repeaters. It typically contains an integral power supply and a variable number of available module slots. Repeater-unit - The portion of the repeater set that is inboard of the physical media interfaces. The physical media interfaces (MAUs, AUIs) may be physically separated from the repeater-unit, or they may be integrated into the same physical package. Trivial repeater-unit - An isolated port that can gather statistics. Group - A recommended, but optional, entity defined by the IEEE 802.3 management standard, in order to support a modular numbering scheme. The classical example allows an implementor to represent field-replaceable units as groups of ports, with the port numbering matching the modular hardware implementation. System interconnect segment - An internal segment allowing interconnection of ports belonging to different physical entities into the same logical manageable repeater. Examples of implementation might be backplane busses in modular hubs, or chaining cables in stacks of hubs. Stack - A scalable system that may include managed repeaters, in which modularity is achieved by interconnecting a number of different chassis. Module - A building block in a modular chassis. It typically maps into one 'slot'; however, the range of configurations may be very large, with several modules entering one slot, or one module covering several slots.

This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective.

On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.

If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer.

Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.

Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.

The value of `global' means that the entry applies to all partner DLSw nodes of the TDomain. The value of 'group' means that the entry applies to a specific set of DLSw nodes in the TDomain. Any group definitions are enterprise-specific and are pointed to by dlswTConnConfigGroupDefinition. In the cases of `global' and `group', the value in dlswTConnConfigRemoteTAddr may not have any significance.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.7,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigGroupDefinition,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,For conceptual rows of `individual' and `global' as specified in dlswTConnConfigEntryType, the instance of this object is `0.0'. For conceptual rows of `group', the instance points to the specific group definition.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.8,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigSetupType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):activePersistent(2):activeOnDemand(3):passive(4):excluded(5),This value of the instance of a conceptual row identifies the behavior of the collection of transport connections that this conceptual row defines. The value of activePersistent, activeOnDemand and passive means this DLSw will accept any transport connections, initiated by partner DLSw nodes, which are defined by this conceptual row. The value of activePersistent means this DLSw will also initiate the transport connections of this conceptual row and retry periodically if necessary. The value of activeOnDemand means this DLSw will initiate a transport connection of this conceptual row, if there is a directory cache hits. The value of other is implementation specific. The value of exclude means that the specified node is not allowed to be a partner to this DLSw node. To take a certain conceptual row definition out of service, a value of notInService for dlswTConnConfigRowStatus should be used. DEFVAL { passive }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.9,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigSapList,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The SAP list indicates which SAPs are advertised to the transport connection defined by this conceptual row. Only SAPs with even numbers are represented, in the form of the most significant bit of the first octet representing the SAP 0, the next most significant bit representing the SAP 2, to the least significant bit of the last octet representing the SAP 254. Data link switching is allowed for those SAPs which have one in its corresponding bit, not allowed otherwise. The whole SAP list has to be changed together. Changing the SAP list affects only new circuit establishments and has no effect on established circuits. This list can be used to restrict specific partners from knowing about all the SAPs used by DLSw on all its interfaces (these are represented in dlswIfSapList for each interface). For instance, one may want to run NetBIOS with some partners but not others. If a node supports sending run-time capabilities exchange messages, changes to this object should cause that action. When to start the run-time capabilities exchange is implementation-specific. The DEFVAL below indicates support for SAPs 0, 4, 8, and C. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.10,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigAdvertiseMacNB,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),The value of true indicates that any defined local MAC addresses and NetBIOS names will be advertised to a partner node via initial and (if supported) run-time capabilities exchange messages. The DLSw node should send the appropriate exclusivity control vector to accompany each list it sends, or to represent that the node is explicitly configured to have a null list. The value of false indicates that the DLSw node should not send a MAC address list or NetBIOS name list, and should also not send their corresponding exclusivity control vectors. DEFVAL { true }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.11,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigInitCirRecvWndw,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,The initial circuit receive pacing window size, in the unit of SSP messages, to be used for future transport connections activated using this table row. The managed node sends this value as its initial receive pacing window in its initial capabilities exchange message. Changing this value does not affect the initial circuit receive pacing window size of currently active transport connections. If the standard window pacing scheme is not supported, the value is zero. A larger receive window value may be appropriate for partners that are reachable only via physical paths that have longer network delays. DEFVAL { 1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.12,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigOpens,Counter32,read-only,,current,,Number of times transport connections entered connected state according to the definition of this conceptual row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.2.1.13,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnConfigRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This object is used by the manager to create or delete the row entry in the dlswTConnConfigTable following the RowStatus textual convention. The value of notInService will be used to take a conceptual row definition out of use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of transport connections. It is optional but desirable for the agent to keep an entry for some period of time after the transport connection is disconnected. This allows the manager to capture additional useful information about the connection, in particular, statistical information and the cause of the disconnection.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperEntry,,not-accessible,dlswTConnOperTDomain:dlswTConnOperRemoteTAddr,current,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.1,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperTDomain,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The object identifier indicates the transport domain of this transport connection.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.2,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperLocalTAddr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The local transport address for this transport connection. This value could be different from dlswTConnConfigLocalAddr, if the value of the latter were changed after this transport connection was established.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.3,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperRemoteTAddr,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The remote transport address of this transport connection.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.4,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperEntryTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The amount of time (in hundredths of a second) since this transport connection conceptual row was created.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.5,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperConnectTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The amount of time (in hundredths of a second) since this transport connection last entered the 'connected' state. A value of zero means this transport connection has never been established.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.6,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperState,INTEGER,read-write,,current,connecting(1):initCapExchange(2):connected(3):quiescing(4):disconnecting(5):disconnected(6),The state of this transport connection. The transport connection enters `connecting' state when DLSw makes a connection request to the transport layer. Once initial Capabilities Exchange is sent, the transport connection enters enters `initCapExchange' state. When partner capabilities have been determined and the transport connection is ready for sending CanUReach (CUR) messages, it moves to the `connected' state. When DLSw is in the process of bringing down the connection, it is in the `disconnecting' state. When the transport layer indicates one of its connections is disconnected, the transport connection moves to the `disconnected' state. Whereas all of the values will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation, only two values may be specified in a management protocol set operation: `quiescing' and `disconnecting'. Changing the value to `quiescing' prevents new circuits from being established, and will cause a transport disconnect when the last circuit on the connection goes away. Changing the value to `disconnecting' will force off all circuits immediately and bring the connection to `disconnected' state.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.7,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperConfigIndex,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,The value of dlswTConnConfigIndex of the dlswTConnConfigEntry that governs the configuration information used by this dlswTConnOperEntry. The manager can therefore normally examine both configured and operational information for this transport connection. This value is zero if the corresponding dlswTConnConfigEntry was deleted after the creation of this dlswTConnOperEntry. If some fields in the former were changed but the conceptual row was not deleted, some configuration information may not be valid for this operational transport connection. The manager can compare dlswTConnOperConnectTime and dlswTConnConfigLastModifyTime to determine if this condition exists.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.8,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperFlowCntlMode,INTEGER,read-only,,current,undetermined(1):pacing(2):other(3),The flow control mechanism in use on this transport connection. This value is undetermined (1) before the mode of flow control can be established on a new transport connection (i.e., after CapEx is sent but before Capex or other SSP control messages have been received). Pacing (2) indicates that the standard RFC 1795 pacing mechanism is in use. Other (3) may be either the RFC 1434+ xBusy mechanism operating to a back-level DLSw, or a vendor-specific flow control method. Whether it is xBusy or not can be inferred from dlswTConnOperPartnerVersion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.9,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerVersion,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This value identifies which version (first octet) and release (second octet) of the DLSw standard is supported by this partner DLSw. This information is obtained from a DLSw capabilities exchange message received from the partner DLSw. A string of zero length is returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, or if one is never received. A conceptual row with a dlswTConnOperState of `connected' but a zero length partner version indicates that the partner is a non-standard DLSw partner. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.10,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerVendorID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This value identifies the IEEE-assigned organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) of the maker of this partner DLSw. This information is obtained from a DLSw capabilities exchange message received from the partner DLSw. A string of zero length is returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, or if one is never received. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.11,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerVersionStr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This value identifies the particular product version (e.g., product name, code level, fix level) of this partner DLSw. The format of the actual version string is vendor-specific. This information is obtained from a DLSw capabilities exchange message received from the partner DLSw. A string of zero length is returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, if one is never received, or if one is received but it does not contain a version string. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.12,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerInitPacingWndw,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,The value of the partner initial receive pacing window. This is our initial send pacing window for all new circuits on this transport connection, as modified and granted by the first flow control indication the partner sends on each circuit. This information is obtained from a DLSw capabilities exchange message received from the partner DLSw. A value of zero is returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, or if one is never received. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.13,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerSapList,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The Supported SAP List received in the capabilities exchange message from the partner DLSw. This list has the same format described for dlswTConnConfigSapList. A string of zero length is returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, or if one is never received. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.14,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerNBExcl,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),The value of true signifies that the NetBIOS names received from this partner in the NetBIOS name list in its capabilities exchange message are the only NetBIOS names reachable by that partner. `False' indicates that other NetBIOS names may be reachable. `False' should be returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, if one is never received, or if one is received without a NB Name Exclusivity CV. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.15,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerMacExcl,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),The value of true signifies that the MAC addresses received from this partner in the MAC address list in its capabilities exchange message are the only MAC addresses reachable by that partner. `False' indicates that other MAC addresses may be reachable. `False' should be returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, if one is never received, or if one is received without a MAC Address Exclusivity CV. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.

This object identifies how much information was kept by this DLSw. These names are stored as userConfigured remote entries in dlswDirNBTable. A value of (4), notApplicable, should be returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, or if one is never received. If an implementation chooses to keep dlswTConnOperEntrys in the `disconnected' state, this value should remain unchanged.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.2.3.1.17,DLSW-MIB::dlswTConnOperPartnerMacInfo,INTEGER,read-only,,current,none(1):partial(2):complete(3):notApplicable(4),It is up to this DLSw whether to keep either none, some, or all of the MAC address list that was received in the capabilities exchange message sent by this partner DLSw. This object identifies how much information was kept by this DLSw. These names are stored as userConfigured remote entries in dlswDirMACTable. A value of (4), notApplicable, should be returned before a Capabilities Exchange message is received, or if one is never received.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.46.1.5.2,DLSW-MIB::dlswCircuitTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table is the circuit representation in the DLSw entity. Virtual data links are used to represent any internal end stations. There is a conceptual row associated with each data link. Thus, for circuits without an intervening transport connection, there are two conceptual rows for each circuit. The table consists of the circuits being established, established, and as an implementation option, circuits that have been disconnected. For circuits carried over transport connections, an entry is created after the CUR_cs was sent or received. For circuits between two locally attached devices, or internal virtual MAC addresses, an entry is created when the equivalent of CUR_cs sent/received status is reached. End station 1 (S1) and End station 2 (S2) are used to represent the two end stations of the circuit. S1 is always an end station which is locally attached. S2 may be locally attached or remote. If it is locally attached, the circuit will be represented by two rows indexed by (A, B) and (B, A) where A & B are the relevant MACs/SAPs. The table may be used to store the causes of disconnection of circuits. It is recommended that the oldest disconnected circuit entry be removed from this table when the memory space of disconnected circuits is needed.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per physical entity. There is always at least one row for an 'overall' physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical entity. Each entry provides objects (entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalVendorType, and entPhysicalClass) to help an NMS identify and characterize the entry and objects (entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalParentRelPos) to help an NMS relate the particular entry to other entries in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of physical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalVendorType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to an enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device. If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.

The RowStatus of a currently active row in the  vrrpOperTable is constrained by the operational state of  the corresponding virtual router.  When `vrrpOperRowStatus' is set to active(1), no other  objects in the conceptual row, with the exception of  `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified. Prior to setting  the `vrrpOperRowStatus' object from `active' to a  different value, the `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be  set to `down' and the `vrrpOperState' object be  transitioned to `initialize'.   To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object  to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until  instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately  configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the  `vrrpOperRowStatus' column will be read as notReady(3).   In particular, a newly created row cannot be made  active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance of  `vrrpOperVrId' has been set and there is at least one  active row in the `vrrpAssoIpAddrTable' defining an  associated IP address for the virtual router.

When `vrrpOperationsRowStatus' is set to  active(1), no other objects in the conceptual row can  be modified.   To create a row in this table, a manager sets this  object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).  Until instances of all corresponding columns are  appropriately configured, the value of the  corresponding instance of the `vrrpOperationsRowStatus'  column will be read as notReady(3).  In particular, a newly created row cannot be made  active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance  of vrrpOperationsInetAddrType, vrrpOperationsVrId and  vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr has been set and there is  at least one active row in the  `vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable' defining an associated  IP address.   notInService(2) should be used to administratively  bring the row down.   A typical order of operation to add a row is:  1. Create a row in vrrpOperationsTable with  createAndWait(5).  2. Create one or more corresponding rows in  vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable.  3. Populate the vrrpOperationsEntry.  4. set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to active(1).   A typical order of operation to delete an entry is:  1. Set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to notInService(2).  2. Set the corresponding rows in  vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable to destroy(6) to delete the  entry.  3. set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to destroy(6) to delete  the entry.

To create a row in this table, a manager sets  this object to either createAndGo(4) or  createAndWait(5). Setting this object to active(1)  results in the addition of an associated address for a  virtual router. Setting this object to notInService(2)  results in administratively bringing down the row.   Destroying the entry or setting it to destroy(6)  removes the associated address from the virtual router.  The use of other values is implementation-dependent.   Only vrrpAssociatedStorageType can be modified when the  row is in active(1) state for Implementations  supporting write access to vrrpAssociatedStorageType   Implementations should not allow deletion of the last  row corresponding to an active row in  vrrpOperationsTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.80.1.2.1.1,DISMAN-PING-MIB::pingCtlOwnerIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (RFC 2575, VACM) for tables in which multiple users may need to create or modify entries independently, the initial index is used as an 'owner index'. Such an initial index has a syntax of SnmpAdminString and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName or groupName defined in VACM, in accordance with a security policy. When used in conjunction with such a security policy, all entries in the table belonging to a particular user (or group) will have the same value for this initial index. For a given user's entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers (except for the 'column' subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion, and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask 'wildcarding' the column subidentifier. More elaborate configurations are possible.

Deletion of an entry in this table results in the deletion of all corresponding (same pingCtlOwnerIndex and pingCtlTestName index values) pingResultsTable and pingProbeHistoryTable entries. A value MUST be specified for pingCtlTargetAddress prior to acceptance of a transition to active(1) state. When a value for pingCtlTargetAddress is set, the value of object pingCtlRowStatus changes from notReady(3) to notInService(2). Activation of a remote ping operation is controlled via pingCtlAdminStatus, not by changing this object's value to active(1). Transitions in and out of active(1) state are not allowed while an entry's pingResultsOperStatus is active(1), with the exception that deletion of an entry in this table by setting its RowStatus object to destroy(6) will stop an active ping operation. The operational state of a ping operation can be determined by examination of its pingResultsOperStatus object.

For VLAN interfaces, on different network devices, which are part of the same globally identified VLAN, the value of this object will be the same.  The binding between a global identifier and a VLAN  interface can be created or removed. To create a binding an NMS must write a non-zero value to this object. To delete a binding, the NMS must write a zero to this object.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.1.14.1.2.1.5,GENERIC-3COM-VLAN-MIB-1-0-7::a3ComVlanIfInfo,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,A TLV encoded information string for the VLAN interface. The information contained within this string corresponds to VLAN information not contained within this table, but contained elsewhere within this MIB module. The purpose of this string is to provide an NMS with a quick read  mechanism of all related VLAN interface information.  The encoding rules are defined according to: tag = 2 bytes length = 2 bytes value = n bytes The following tags are defined: TAG OBJECT DESCRIPTION 1 a3ComIpVlanIpNetAddress IP Network Address of IP VLAN  2 a3ComIpVlanIpNetMask IP Network Mask of IP VLAN

This OBJECT can be set to: active(1) createAndGo(4) createAndWait(5) destroy(6) The following values may be read: active(1) notInService(2) notReady(3).  Setting this object to createAndGo(4) causes the agent to attempt to create and commit the row based on  the contents of the objects in the row. If all necessary information is present in the row and the values are acceptible to the agent, the agent will change the  status to active(1). If any of the necessary objects  are not available, the agent will reject the creation request.  Setting this object to createAndWait(5) causes a row in in this table to be created. The agent sets the status to notInService(2) if all of the information is present in the row and the values are acceptible to the agent; otherwise, the agent sets the status to notReady(3). Setting this object to active(1) is only valid when the current status is active(1) or notInService(2).  When the state of the row transitions to active(1), the agent creates the corresponding row in the ifTable.. Setting this object to destroy(6) will remove the corresponding VLAN interface, remove the entry in this table, and the corresponding entries in the a3ComVlanGlobalMappingTable and the ifTable. In order for a set of this object to destroy(6) to succeed, all dependencies on this row must have been removed.

Row creation using the current value of this object, allocates a virtual ifIndex. Note the following:  1. A newly created row does not have to be active(1) for the agent to allocate the virtual ifIndex. 2. Race conditions between multiple NMS's end when a row is created. Rows are deemed created when a setRequest is successfully committed (i.e. the errorStats is noError(0)). 3. An agent that exhausts its supply of virual ifIndex values returns zero as the value of this object. This can be used by an NMS as an indication to deleted unused rows and reboot the device.

In order for a row to become active, the NMS must set a3ComVlanEncapsIfTagType and a3ComVlanEncapsIfTag to some valid and consistent values.  Setting this object to createAndGo(4) causes the agent to attempt to create and commit the row based on the contents of the objects in the row. If all necessary information is present in the row, the agent will create the row and change the status to active(1). If any of the necessary objects are not available, or specify an invalid configuration, the row will not be created and the agent will return an appropriate error. Setting this object to createAndWait(5) causes a row in in this table to be created. If all necessary objects in the row have been assigned values and specify a valid configuration, the status of the row will be set to notInService(2); otherwise, the status will be set to notReady(3).  This object may only be set to createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5) if it does not exist. Setting this object to active(1) when the status is notInService(2) causes the agent to commit the row. Setting this object to active(1) when its value is already active(1) is a no-op. Setting this object to destroy(6) will remove the corresponding VLAN encapsulation interface, remote the entry in this table, and remove the corresponding entry in the ifTable. In order for a set of this object to destroy(6) to succeed, all dependencies on this row must have been removed. These will include any references to this interface in the ifStackTable.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resTableEntry,,not-accessible,resRepeater:resMainSlot:resMainPort,mandatory,,An device may be configured to contain a number of 'resilient pairs'. These are to point connections, e.g. UTP, that allow two repeaters/switches to be connected together in a resilient configuration. In such a configuration one of the two ports is nominated the 'main' port while the other is the 'standby' port. One of these two ports is enabled and is the current active port. The other is present in case of failure of the active port. Such a failure is detected by the device and a switch performed.  In the case of repeaters, there are a couple of rules that must apply to a  resilient pair definition before that definition becomes a valid resilient pair. Firstly both ports must be on the same repeater. Secondly the standby port must be configured to be 'disabled on boot'. That is it must recover from a power failure in a disabled state. This prevents loops in the network.  There are two modes of operation. These are defined by the resPairMode object. See that object for a full description. Several tables control the resilient configuration for the device.  This is the first. This is the main table and allows the creation and deletion of pairs and provides status control and information. The information in this table is indexed on the repeater number, the slot (or unit) and the port location of the main port.  To create a new resilient pair simply write any writeable object indexed on the main port. This will create a new entry in the table which has the state invalid(1) (read resPairState). Having created the row, write to the other parameters specifying valid information. When all the parameters are valid and 'resPairModificationStatus' is set to 'stable(2)', then resPairState will become operational(2). In this state the pair will correctly operate as a resilient pair. If any of the attributes in the table change so that the pair in no linger valid this will be reflected in the resPortState parameter. To delete a resilient pair, write delete(2) to resPairAction.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.1,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resRepeater,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,A resilient pair must be attached to one of the repeaters in  the chassis. This is part of the index value required to access this table.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.2,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resMainSlot,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,This is the second key in the index to this table. This is  the slot number of the main port in this pair.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.4,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resMainState,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,failed(1):ok(2):ok-and-active(3),Each port in a pair is constantly monitored for signs of  failure. Failure information is used to automatically change the active port  from main to standby or vice-versa. Each port may be in one of three states.  Failed(1) indicates there is a loss of signal on this port. A port in this state  cannot be active. Secondly ok(2). This state indicates that the port is capable  of carrying traffic but is at the moment acting in the role of backup link. The  other port in this pair will be in the Ok-and-active(3) state.  Ok-and-active(3) means what it says, this port is capable of carrying traffic  and is so doing at the time this parameter has been read.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.5,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resStandbySlot,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,This is the slot number of the standby port for this pair.

Failure information is used to automatically change the active port  from main to standby or vice-versa. Each port may be in one of three states.  Failed(1) indicates there is a loss of signal on this port. A port in this state  cannot be active. Secondly ok(2). This state indicates that the port is capable  of carrying traffic but is at the moment acting in the role of backup link. The  other port in this pair will be in the Ok-and-active(3) state.  Ok-and-active(3) means what it says, this port is capable of carrying traffic  and is so doing at the time this parameter has been read.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.8,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resPairState,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,invalid(1):operational(2),Each row in the table is in one of two states, invalid(1) or  operational(2). If the state is invalid(1), the resilient pair represented by  this row is not active. There are several reasons why this may be the case.  Firstly during the row creation process, not all information necessary may have been  provided. Secondly an operational pair may become invalid because the  resilient pair rules are no longer met because of a change in the device configuration.   If the parameters in the row are all valid then the pair becomes operational(2).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.9,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resPairModificationStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,under-modification(1):stable(2),This parameter must be set to under-modification(1) before any  changes are made to an existing configuration.

The create(1) operation configures the resilient port from this table  entry. The delete(2) operation removes the resilient definitions from this table  and terminates operation of resilience on this pair of ports. The togglePort(3)  operation allows the current active port to be changed to the other port.  This second operation will only take affect if the state of the currently non- active port is ok(2).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.11,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resPairEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,enable(1):disable(2),This parameter controls whether the resilient pair is  enabled or not. In the disable(2) state , both ports of the resilient pair are  disabled. The default value of this parameter is enable(1).

The value no-switch-back(1) means that both ports are treated equally. The value switch-back-to-main(2) means that when it is operational, precedence is always given to the main port. If the main port has been stable for 1 minute, then the pair will automatically switch the active port to main. The default value of this parameter is no-switch-back(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.15.1.1.13,A3COM0304-RESILIENTLINKS::resPairName,OCTET,read-write,,mandatory,,The textual name of the interface.

IP nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn - dotted format MAC AABBCCDDEEFF - hex notation IPX AABBCCDD:AABBCCDDEEFF - network : node  If the format is unrecognised then a badValue error is returned. This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal  to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.4,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollProtocol,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,unknown(1):ip(2):ipx(3):netBIOS(4):appleTalk(5):amp(6):llc(7),This defines the protocol with which to monitor the device.  Writing an address to the remPollAddress field causes a default remPollProtocol  value to be setup. The default value is derived from the format/content of the  address. If the requested protocol is not supported or is not compatible with  the remPollAddress, then an error is returned when an attempt is made to set the  remPollStatus to valid.  If the requested protocol is not supported then a badValue error should be returned. If the requested protocol is not compatible with the remPollAddress then an error is returned when an attempt is made to set the remPollStatus to valid.   This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal  to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.6,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollTimeout,TimeTicks,read-write,,mandatory,,The time-out value in hundreds of a second for each request  packet. If a device replies to a request packet within the specified time-out,  then the poll is judged to be successful.  This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal  to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.7,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollAttempts,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The number of unsuccessful requests necessary before  deciding that the device is definitely not responding.  This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal  to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.8,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollPeriod,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The device will be polled every remPollPeriod seconds. The  first poll is sent as soon as the remPollStatus is set to valid(1). To prevent  overlapping polls, the value of remPollPeriod must be greater than  2*remPollTimeout*remPollAttempts - otherwise an error is returned when the row  is set to valid.  A poll consists of sending up to remPollAttempts request packets to the device.  A reply to any of the request packets is sufficient to declare the poll  successful (and stop further requests from being sent). A poll is deemed  unsuccessful if no replies have been received after  remPollTimeout*remPollAttempts seconds from the start of the poll. Note: each  request packet must contain some sequence information so that late replies do  not result in a successful poll.  The first unsuccessful poll causes a PollFailure event to be generated - further  unsuccessful polls do not generate events. The next successful poll to the  device causes a PollSuccess event to be generated - further successful polls do  not generate events. The pattern then repeats.  The value 0 has a special value meaning of only-once When remPollStatus is set  to valid(1), a single poll is started immediately. There are no events  generated. whether the poll has been judged successful or unsuccessful.  The results of the poll(s) can be monitored by reading the remPollLastRequest  and remPolLastReply fields.  This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal  to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.9,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollLastRequest,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,This is the value of sysUpTime at which the most recent request packet was sent.  To avoid temporary inconsistancies between the values of remPollLastRequest and  remPollLastReply. The value of remPollLastRequest should not be updated until  the end of a poll. At which point (a) remPollLastRequest is updated to the  sysUpTime when the most recent request packet was sent and (b) if the poll was  successful then remPollLastReply is also updated.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.10,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollLastReply,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,This is the value of sysUpTime at which the most recent reply packet was received. The device was responding at this time.  The relationship of sysUpTime, remPollLastRequest and remPollLastReply provide  the following information:  (sysUpTime - remPollLastRequest) = time since last request was made. (sysUpTime  - remPollLastReply) = time since device last responded.  if( remPollLastReply => remPollLastRequest) then (remPollLastReply - remPollLastRequest) = round trip time of last request else if( remPollLastReply <remPollLastRequest) then there was no reply to the last request - the device is not responding  
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.25.1.1.1.11,A3COM0019-RMON-REMOTE-POLL::remPollInformation,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,After each successful poll, this field is updated with some  protocol specific information that was gleaned from the packet exchange.

The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as  identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no  corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In  particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as  zero is not a valid event index.  This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal to valid(1).

The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as  identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no  corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In  particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as  zero is not a valid event index.  This object may not be modified if the associated remPollStatus object is equal to valid(1).

Note that scripts executed by this table  do not have to reside in the macro table. A script is identified by its  'cmdExecMacroName'. The agent will search all available script sources  for that named script. The script _may_ be found in the macro table but  this is not mandated.

The various possible  values are described as follows: inactive : This process is not currently executing any script. This is  the default state after creating a row in the table. running: The process is currently executing a script, and that script  is not currently blocked by any internal asynchronous  activity. 'running' actually means that this process is  capable of being scheduled and is in a 'ready to run'  scheduling queue. suspended: The script being executed by this process is currently  blocked waiting for the completion of some asynchronous  activity. dying: The script that was being executed by this process has  completed and is waiting to be tidied up. When the tidyup  has been completed this process will either automatically be  destroyed or will enter the 'inactive' state. paused: The script being executed has been manually stopped,  generally for debug purposes. A script can enter this state  either voluntarily be requesting the system to stop it (ie  similar to a breakpoint) or can be paused by writing to the  cmdExecOperation variable. searching: When a process is given a script to execute the engine must  first find that script. The script is identified by name (spe cified in cmdExecMacroName). The agent must search all  possible sources for the script, which may take some time.  The MIB allows the script to be specified by any name and so  some implementations may allow the name to identify a file  on some remote file system, for example by using a URL.  While the agent searches for the script the process enters  the 'searching' state. If the agent locates the script it  will enter the 'running' state. If the script cannot be  located then the process re-enters the 'inactive' state.

Note that this variable can only be set if the row- status is valid. Operations are: none - Value returned for _any_ read operation. execute - If the operational state of the macro is 'inactive' then this command will attempt to execute the script named in cmdMacroName. If the process is in any other state this command will be rejected. suspend - This command will suspend the process at the end of the current statement. Command is rejected if the macro is inactive. continue - If a macro is suspended due to a 'suspend' command this will cause it to continue execution from its current point. step - Execute the next statement and then stop. kill - Stop this process from running and put it in the inactive state. Note that this deletes all resource associated with the executing script, but not the process itself. abort - If the current macro status is 'suspended' Will cause it to terminate at its current point. next - Execute the next statement, stepping over child processes.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.27.1.1.1.2,A3COM0017-STACK-CONFIG::stackUnitAddress,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,Every conformant unit in the SuperStack II system will have  a unique physical (MAC) address by which it can be recognised. Note  that the location index on this table can change if a unit is inserted  into the stack and so the location can not be used to uniquely identify  a location. Instead an application should refer to units by their  physical address.

The values  of this integer are administered by allocating a MIB object identifier  for each type of unit from a common branch. The value of this object is  then the last level in that identifier. The values are defined in this  MIB module. Note that the values are unlikely to be contiguous. Note that if a type value is not available for this unit then this  object will return zero. There are several reasons why this value may  not be available through this view of the MIB. One reason may be that  the device is not currently active (dead) or that the information is  only available through the units own agent (see stackUnitManagementType) .
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.27.1.1.1.5,A3COM0017-STACK-CONFIG::stackUnitDesc,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,This is a text string which describes this unit. If a unit  cannot provide a name then the value of this object will be an empty  string.

The unknown state is not expected to be used, but may exist  because of loosely integrated components in the stack. Management  applications MUST EXPECT to see the 'unknown' value. The other states  are as follows: unitInactive: The device has failed to respond send out periodic update  messages, but it still appears to be in the stack. unitOperational: The unit is sending our periodic identification  messages and indicates that it is operational, running its complete  image. unitLoading: The unit is running is a special operational mode which  means that it is unmanaged while it loads a new operational code image. Note that if the stack ever contains units which can download an  operational image while still being fully managed then this variable  will report 'unitOperational'.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.27.1.1.1.8,A3COM0017-STACK-CONFIG::stackUnitManagementType,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,unknown(1):distributed(2):intelligent(3),This object can be used to determine the management method  used to access the agent in this unit. The options are: unknown: The unit has not reported any management capability. It  is either faulty or a non-conformant device. distributed: This unit can be managed using the SuperStackII  distributed management architecture and so is managed  through this agent. The unit may or may not have an  active comms stack. If it has then the addresses for  that agent can be determined from the address table. intelligent: The unit has its own SNMP agent which is accessed  seperately. The agent is not part of the SSII  distributed management architecture.

This is used in conjunction with the upgrade level of the stack  to enable a management application to correctly enable and disable the  various features of the application depending on the capabilities of  the unit. The object is an octet string, where each octet represents a capability  of the unit. Different capabilities will be added to the list as  required. The current list of values is: 0x01 Full RMON 0x02 3Com Proprietary Resilience MIB 0x03 3Com Repeater Security MIB 0x04 PSHub Port Switching 0x05 PSHub Capability Upgrade Facility 0x06 Dual Speed Hub Capability Upgrade Facility  0x07 TelNet 0x08 Web  0x14 SMA Resource Allocator  0x15 SMA Distributed SNMP  0x16 SMA Global Variables  0x17 SMA Licence Server 0x18 PSHub Cascade Switch  0x19 PSH Load Balancing So, for example, if a unit has a value of '02 03' for this object then  it supports repeater resilience and security, but no other features  such as RMON.

This is useful for directing  maintainance personnel. The method often employed is for a special LED,  or by placing some other LED into a flashing state. This object gives  access to the attention mechanism for a unit. Note that if a unit does not support this mechanism then reading the  value of this object will return 'no-such-name' error. The possible  values for an instance of this object which does exist is 'noAttention'  or 'attention'.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.1,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackFwdingMode,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,fastForward(1):fragmentFree(2):storeAndForward(3):intelligent(4),This object controls whether cut-thru is enabled on the stack. Enabling cut-thru can help to minimise the delay experienced by packets before they are forwarded to their destination. Setting cut-thru to 'fastForward' causes frame forwarding to begin as soon as 32 bytes of the frame have been received. Setting it to 'fragmentFree' causes frame forwarding to begin when 64 bytes have been received. This is slower, but eliminates the risk of forwarding an illegally short frame to the destination port, however a valid length frame might still be forwarded even though it had a CRC error. Setting this object to 'storeAndForward' disables cut-thru completely, and frames will not be forwarded until they have been received in their entirety. When the mode is set to intelligent, the effective switching mode is set initially to fast forward. The switch then monitors the total error rate of frames received on each port, and if it exceeds 20 error frames a second it changes the effective mode for the port to store and forward. If the error rate then drops to zero the effective mode is restored to fast forward. Whatever forwarding mode is selected, cut-thru cannot operate if the destination port is currently involved in 'cut-thru' from another port. In this case the device will process the frame in store and forward mode.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.2,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackPaceMode,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):normalEthernet(2):lowLatency(3),This object specifies the type of backoff algorithm used on the units in the stack. Any port can use the standard ethernet algorithm or, for PACE applications, it can be set into low latency mode. In this mode, the backoff algorithm is optimised to minimise the possibility of collisions. The value of this object defines the setting that those ports will use which have prConPortPaceMode set to useDefault(2). PACE mode can be set for the whole stack or for individual ports. When a unit is initialised to factory defaults, prconPortPaceMode for every port is set to useDefault(2), and the actual setting for the port is decided by the value of this object. The manager has the choice, therefore, of varying the mode for every port in the stack, or for individual ports only.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.3,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackVLANConfigMode,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):portMode(2):autoSelect(3),This object specifies the VLAN mode to be used. Setting it to portMode(2) requires the user to configure each port's VLAN membership individually, whereas autoSelect(3) causes it to acquire its membership from the VLAN Server. The value of this object defines the setting that those ports will use which have prConPortVLANConfigMode set to useDefault(2). VLAN mode can be set for the whole stack or for individual ports. When a unit is initialised to factory defaults, prconPortVLANConfigMode for every port is set to useDefault(2), and the actual setting for the port is decided by the value of this object. The manager has the choice, therefore, of varying the mode for every port in the stack, or for individual ports only.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.4,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackRAPStudyPort,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,This determines the ifIndex of the port a user wishes to monitor on the copy port. Monitoring causes all data from the study port to be copied to the copy port. The port is specified using its ifIndex because that uniquely identifies a single port in the stack.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.5,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackRAPCopyPort,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,This is the value of ifIndex specifying the port to which data will be copied (mirrored), and must be set to a valid value, along with the study port, before monitoring can be enabled.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.6,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackRAPEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,off(1):on(2),This object controls the Roving Analysis Port (RAP) feature in conjunction with prConStackRAPStudyPort and prConStackRAPCopyPort. The RAP feature allows all frames sent and received on the study port to be copied to the copy port, where they can be observed. Setting this object to on(2) will enable monitoring. To succeed both prConStackRAPStudyPort and prConStackRAPCopyPort must have been set to the ifIndex values of suitable ports, and if either are invalid this operation will fail.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.7,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConStackBridgeMode,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,single(1):multiple(2),The value of this object determines whether the switch is to operate as a single bridge or as a bridge per VLAN (the default). In multiple bridge mode the switch maintains a separate filtering database for each VLAN, whereas in single bridge mode it uses a single database for them all. Thus in multiple bridge mode the MAC address of a station can be learnt on more than one port provided they are in separate VLANs, while in single bridge mode the switch makes just one entry for each address. Multiple bridge mode is useful in that separate VLANs may be joined by a bridge external to the switch, whereas in single bridge mode VLANs may only be connected by routers. Not all switches will support both modes, and any attempt to set the mode to an unsupported value will be rejected.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.9,A3COM0420-SWITCH-EXTENSIONS::prConStackIpTos,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):enable(2):disable(3),This object is used to enable the classification of packets based upon the value of their IPToS field. When enabled, the packet's Traffic Classification will be derived from both the 802.1D user_priority and the IPToS field. Where the two methods indicate different Traffic Classifications, then higher of the two will be selected. Each device will only support the enumerations that are applicable to that device. Attempting to set the object to a non-supported mode will be rejected.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.10,A3COM0420-SWITCH-EXTENSIONS::prConStackPktRateControl,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):disable(2):limitUnknownDAs(3):limitMcasts(4):limitMcastsAndUnknownDAs(5):limitBcasts(6):limitBcastsAndUnknownDAs(7):limitBcastsAndMcasts(8):limitBcastsMcastsAndUnknownDAs(9),This object controls whether the packet rate control feature is enabled or disabled. Products which do not support this feature will return notApplicable(1) and reject any attempt to set it to a different value. When set to disable(2) the switch will not perform any rate limiting. If set to any of the remaining values the switch will monitor the throughput of the specified type(s) of frame and discard some if necessary to reduce the throughput to the amount specified by the value of prConStackPktRateLimit. The enumerations select which types of packet are to be rate limited as follows:- limitUnknownDAs(3) Unicast Frames with a destination address not in the filtering database limitMcasts(4) Multicasts limitMcastsAndUnknownDAs(5) Multicasts, and unicasts with unknown destination addresses limitBcasts(6) Broadcasts limitBcastsAndUnknownDAs(7) Broadcasts, and unicasts with unknown destination addresses limitMcastsAndBcasts(8) Multicasts and Broadcasts limitMcastsBcastsAndUnknownDAs(9) All the above types of frame
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.1.11,A3COM0420-SWITCH-EXTENSIONS::prConStackPktRateLimit,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,This object specifies the maximum rate at which the selected types of packet may be received from a port before excess packets are discarded. The limit is specified in packets per second. To assist in calculating a suitable limit, note that the absolute maximum transmission rates of packets on an ethernet network is 10Mbps: 14880 and 100Mbps: 148800

If not operational, all units  need to be upgraded to the latest agent version. For example,  this value shall be set to 'not operational' if any unit in the stack does not have the capability to support LACP.

Setting it to portMode(3) requires the user to configure the port's VLAN membership explicitly, whereas autoSelect(4) causes it to acquire its membership from the VLAN Server. VLAN mode can be set for the whole stack or for individual ports. When a unit is initialised to factory defaults, prConPortVLANConfigMode for every port is set to useDefault(2), and the actual setting for the port is decided by the value of prConStackVLANConfigMode. The other values of this object allow the setting to be varied for the individual port.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.2,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConPortIFM,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):off(2):maxJams6(3):maxJams7(4):maxJams8(5):maxJams9(6):maxJams10(7):maxJams11(8):maxJams12(9):maxJams13(10),This object controls Intelligent Flow Management for the port, which specifies what action the port takes whenever it is unable to receive a packet because its buffers are full. When set to off(1), the packet is dropped immediately. If it is set to any of the values maxJams6(2) to maxJams13(10), a jam signal is transmitted to the segment attached to the port to force a collision so that the originator will stop and retransmit the frame. This will be repeated a maximum of 6 to 13 times depending on the setting. If the port is then still unable to receive the packet it is dropped. Intelligent Flow Management should be disabled on ports which are connected to repeater segments. Intelligent flow management only functions when a port is operating in half duplex, either as a result of auto-negotiation, or by management action.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.3,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConPortDiscardOnTx,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):off(2):on(3),This object controls whether the 'Discard-on-transmit' feature is enabled for frames originating at this port. If set to on(3), the unit will discard frames destined for any other port if that port's transmit buffers are full. If this attribute is set to off(2), a frame will be held until that port has space available for the frame.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.4,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConPortPaceMode,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):useDefault(2):normalEthernet(3):lowLatency(4),This object specifies the type of backoff algorithm used on the port. A port can use the standard ethernet algorithm or, for PACE applications, it can be set to low latency mode. In this mode, the backoff algorithm is optimised to minimise the possibility of collisions. PACE mode can be set for the whole stack or for individual ports. When a unit is initialised to factory defaults this object is set to useDefault(2) for every port, and the actual setting for the port is decided by the value of prConStackPaceMode. The manager has the choice, therefore, of varying the mode for every port in the stack, or for individual ports only.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.5,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConPortStpFastStart,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,off(1):on(2),This object specifies whether a switch port will go to the forwarding state immediately if spanning tree is turned on. When this object is set to on(2), the normal intermediate startup states of listening and learning are skipped and the port is allowed to enter the forwarding spanning tree state immediately. This is to allow switch ports that are directly connected to just one endstation to be immediately available when the link is detected or the switch powers up. Note that this object must be set of off(1) for all switch ports that are connected to ethernet segments or other switches, routers or bridges.  The default state for all ports is off(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.6,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConPortFlowCntlStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,enabled(1):disabled(2):notApplicable(3),This object represents the operational full duplex flow control state of the port, as determined by either (1) the result of auto-negotiation, or (2) if auto-negotiation is not enabled for this port, by the value of the object prConPortFlowCntlDefaultStatus. In the latter case a set to prConPortFlowCntlDefaultStatus will force the port into the new operating mode.  If the port is operating in half duplex, the value of this object is notApplicable(3).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.7,A3COM0054-BRASICA2-SPECIFIC::prConPortFlowCntlDefaultStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,enabled(1):disabled(2),This object represents the administratively-configured full duplex flow control status of the port. If auto-negotiation is not enabled for this port, the value of this object determines the operational full duplex flow control status, and in this case a set to this object will force the port into the specified state. If auto-negotiation is enabled for this port, the operational status of the port is determined by auto-negotiation and indicated by the value of the prConPortFlowCntlStatus object. The value of this object denotes the state to which the port will automatically revert should auto-negotiation be disabled. The value of this object is ignored if the port is operating in half duplex mode.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.13,A3COM0420-SWITCH-EXTENSIONS::prConPortIFM,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,notApplicable(1):off(2):maxJams6(3):maxJams7(4):maxJams8(5):maxJams9(6):maxJams10(7):maxJams11(8):maxJams12(9):maxJams13(10),This object controls Intelligent Flow Management for the port, which specifies what action the port takes whenever it is unable to receive a packet because its buffers are full. When set to off(2), the packet is dropped immediately. If it is set to any of the values maxJams6(3) to maxJams13(10), a jam signal is transmitted to the segment attached to the port to force a collision so that the originator will stop and retransmit the frame. This will be repeated a maximum of 6 to 13 times depending on the setting. If the port is then still unable to receive the packet it is dropped. Intelligent Flow Management should be disabled on ports which are connected to ree Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol, defined by IEEE Std. 802.1w.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.14,A3COM0420-SWITCH-EXTENSIONS::prConPortLacp,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,enable(1):disable(2),This object specifies whether a port will use LACP. When enabled LACP will be active on the port. When disabled LACP will cease this may cause a port to be taken out of an aggregation.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.34.2.1.1.15,A3COM0420-SWITCH-EXTENSIONS::prConPortStpAdminPathCost,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The administratively assigned value of the path cost for this port. The contribution of this port to the path cost of paths towards the spanning tree root which include this port. 802.1D-1990 recommends that the default value of this parameter be in inverse proportion to the speed of the attached LAN. This is similar to the dot1dStpPortPathCost MIB item, except that writing a value of '0' assigns the port to use the automatically calculated default Path Cost value. If the default Path Cost is being used, this item returns '0'.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.1,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmIndex,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.2,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmInterval,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.3,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmVariable,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).

If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.6,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmValue,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.7,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-write,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.8,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmRisingThreshold,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.9,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmFallingThreshold,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.10,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmRisingEventIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.1.3.4.4.1.1.11,A3COM-HUWAEI-LswPERFORMANCE-MIB::prialarmFallingEventIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index.

Example A describes the relation between values of hwMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList and hwMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList. Example A: hwMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList: '00000002 0C000022 00000007' hwMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList: '00000002 00000001 00000002' Every four octets represent an integer value. The first four octets of them should be same. Here the value '00000002' indicates there are two inbound mirror sources. The following every four octets of hwMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList indicate an ifIndex or a slot number of mirror source. For '0C000022' and '00000007' in the value of hwMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList above, the corresponding value of hwMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList is '00000001' and '00000002'(00000001 means the mirror source is port, 00000002 means the  mirror source is board, the meaning reference the object HwMirrorOrMonitorType),  then '0C000022' indicates an ifIndex value 201326626(decimal), and '00000007'  indicates a slot with number 7(decimal). Values with different types(port/board) should be set in separate set operations. If one value with port type and one value with board type are set with same hwMirroringGroupID separately, the result of get operation for that entry will be like the example A above.  If hwMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList is not supported, the first four octets of hwMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList also indicates the number of mirror source, but the following octets are values for ifIndex(port type). hwMirroringGroupMirrorOutboundIfIndexList and hwMirroringGroupMirrorOutTypeList are a pair and have the same relations like hwMirroringGroupMirrorInboundIfIndexList and hwMirroringGroupMirrorInTypeList pair.

Virtual data links are used to represent any internal end stations. There is a conceptual row associated with each data link. Thus, for circuits without an intervening transport connection, there are two conceptual rows for each circuit. The table consists of the circuits being established, established, and as an implementation option, circuits that have been disconnected. For circuits carried over transport connections, an entry is created after the CUR_cs was sent or received. For circuits between two locally attached devices, or internal virtual MAC addresses, an entry is created when the equivalent of CUR_cs sent/received status is reached. End station 1 (S1) and End station 2 (S2) are used to represent the two end stations of the circuit. S1 is always an end station which is locally attached. S2 may be locally attached or remote. If it is locally attached, the circuit will be represented by two rows indexed by (A, B) and (B, A) where A & B are the relevant MACs/SAPs. The table may be used to store the causes of disconnection of circuits. It is recommended that the oldest disconnected circuit entry be removed from this table when the memory space of disconnected circuits is needed.

One entry in this table contains information on a single range of labels represented by the configured Upper and Lower Bounds VPI/VCI pairs. NOTE: The ranges for a specific LDP Entity are UNIQUE and non-overlapping. For example, for a specific LDP Entity index, there could be one entry having ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/32, and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/100, and a second entry for this same interface with ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/101 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/200. However, there could not be a third entry with ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/200 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/300 because this label range overlaps with the second entry (i.e. both entries now have 0/200). A row will not be created unless a unique and non-overlapping range is specified. Thus, row creation implies a one-shot row creation of LDP EntityID and ConfLowerBound vpi/vci and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci.

One entry in this table contains information on a single range of labels represented by the configured Upper and Lower Bounds VPI/VCI pairs. NOTE: The ranges for a specific LDP Peer are UNIQUE and non-overlapping. For example, for a specific LDP Peer index, there could be one entry having ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/32, and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/100, and a second entry for this same interface with ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/101 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/200. However, there could not be a third entry with ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/200 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/300 because this label range overlaps with the second entry (i.e. both entries now have 0/200). A row will not be created unless a unique and non-overlapping range is specified. Thus, row creation implies a one-shot row creation of LDP PeerIndex and ConfLowerBound vpi/vci and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci. At least one label range entry for a specific LDP Peer MUST include the default VPI/VCI values denoted in the LDP Peer Table.

For devices which support dual image: If the value is 'main(1)',the image will be the first image in the next reloading procedure. If the value is 'backup(2)', the image will be used if the main image fails. If the value is 'secure(4)', the image will be used if the main image and backup image both fail. If the value is 'none(3)',the image will not be used in the next reloading procedure. At the same time,you also can specify the main image by h3cSysReloadImage in h3cSysReloadScheduleTable. If the image is different from previous main image, the previous main image will not be main image again. And the image table will update with this variation. Vice versa, if you have defined the reload schedule, and then you define a new main image through h3cSysImageType when you are waiting the reload schedule to be executed, the real main image will be the latest one. It is strongly suggested to define the main image here, not by h3cSysReloadImage in h3cSysReloadScheduleTable. There are some rules for setting the value of h3cSysImageType: a)When a new image file is defined as 'main' or 'backup' file,the h3cSysImageType of old 'main' or 'backup' file will automatically be 'none'. b)It is forbidden to set 'none' attribute manually. c)It is forbidden to set 'secure' attribute manually. d)If 'main' image is set to 'backup', the file keeps 'main'. And vice versa.

Each time a port is placed into guaranteed mode it reserves a set amount of power out of the total guaranteed power pool for the system. This intention of this object is to give the client of this MIB (whether that be the CLI or the Web interface or the end user) an indication of how many ports can still be placed into guaranteed mode. It is a read only integer value with units of Watts(note - Watts is chosen instead of milliWatts here since the IETF Power MIB [1] measures unit based parameters,such as the pethMainPsePower object, in units of Watts).

Network managers can allocate different QOS profile groups to different users. Once the user is on line, then the user-specified QOS profiles will be dynamically applied to the port the user connects. Each port can have different groups of users simultaneously connected. Each group of users can have assiociation with multiple QOS profiles simultaneously. So the user's port,MAC address,IP address and VLAN ID will replace the source information in the ACL rules refered in the QOS profiles. Once the user is off line, then the user-specified QOS profiles will be dynamically deleted from the port the user connects.

Traffic from the OUI authorised device will be accepted even if the user has not been authenticated. Need To Know and Intrusion Action depends on h3cSecureNeedToKnowMode and h3cSecureIntrusionAction respectively. macAddressWithRadius(8) This selects the RADIUS Authenticated Login using MAC-address (RALM) security mode on the port. This feature controls network access of a host based on authenticating its MAC address. Once authorised, the host is allowed access to the network. If unauthorised, the port can be configured to deny access to this MAC address or to allow some access depending upon the port VLAN and QoS configuration. Where access is allowed, the MAC address is added to the Secure Address Table. macAddressOrUserLoginSecure(9) This selects both the macAddressWithRadius and userLoginSecure modes together such that either or both are allowed to authorised access. Where both authorised access, userLoginSecure takes precedence. macAddressElseUserLoginSecure(10) This selects both the macAddressWithRadius and userLoginSecure modes together such that the MAC address is first authenticated and only if this fails does the userLoginSecure then attempt user authentication. userLoginSecureExt(11) Access to the port is denied unti

Sub interfaces are logical virtual interfaces configured on a main interface. The main interface can be either a physical interface (such as a Layer 3 Ethernet interface) or a logical interface (such as an MFR interface). The subinterfaces on a main interface share the physical layer parameters of the main interface but can have link layer and network layer parameters of their own. Disabling or enabling a subinterface does not affect the main interface, but the main interface status change affects the subinterfaces. The subinterfaces cannot operate normally unless the main interface is connected. A single physical interface containing multiple subinterfaces enables you to network in a more flexible way. You can create subinterfaces for the following physical interfaces: Ethernet interface. An Ethernet subinterface associated with no VLAN supports only IPX, while an Ethernet subinterface associated with a VLAN supports both IP and IPX. WAN interfaces with their data link layer protocols being frame relay, whose subinterfaces support IP and IPX. WAN interfaces with their data link layer protocols being X.25, whose subinterfaces support IP and IPX. ATM interface, whose subinterfaces support only IP.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.10.2.42.3,A3COM-HUAWEI-EFM-COMMON-MIB::h3cEfmOamMIB,,,,,,The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile task force (IEEE 802.3ah). The functionality presented here is based on IEEE 802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004. In particular, this MIB focused on the changes to Clause 30 of the draft that are not specific to any physical layer. These changes are primarily reflected in the new OAM features developed under this project, that can be applied to any Ethernet like interface. The OAM features are described in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. This mib is excerpted from the draft files directly,only changed the object name,added the h3c as prefix. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [802.3ah] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004: 'Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan are networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', October 2004.

There will be one row in this table for each Ethernet like interface in the system that supports the Ethernet OAM functions defined in [802.3ah].

This object represents the desired state of OAM for this interface. The h3cDot3OamAdminState always starts in the disabled(1) state until an explicity management action or configuration information retained by the system causes a transition to the enabled(2) state. Note that the value of this object is ignored when the interface is not operating in full-duplex mode. OAM is not supported on half-duplex links. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.10.2.42.3.1.1.1.2,A3COM-HUAWEI-EFM-COMMON-MIB::h3cDot3OamOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,disabled(1):linkfault(2):passiveWait(3):activeSendLocal(4):sendLocalAndRemote(5):sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6):oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7):oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8):operational(9),At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link. The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OAM sublayer. This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the h3cDot3OamAdminState. If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (h3cDot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OAM capable. The activeSendLocal(4) is used by active mode devices (h3cDot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination. The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OAM entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet. Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10). If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided. This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAM PDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11). When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5]. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.10.2.42.3.1.1.1.3,A3COM-HUAWEI-EFM-COMMON-MIB::h3cDot3OamMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,active(1):passive(2),This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this Ethernet like interface. OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in 'active' mode or 'passive' mode. These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OAM actions with it. As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OAM entity cannot. Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the h3cDot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9).

OAM consists of separate functional sets beyond the basic discovery process which is always required. These functional groups can be supported independently by any implementation. These values are communicated to the peer via the local configuration field of Information OAMPDUs.

OAM entities communicate with a single OAM peer entity on full-duplex Ethernet links on which OAM is enabled and operating properly. In certain states, the OAM peer information is not available. Whether peer information is available is communicated via the h3cDot3OamPeerStatus object. When this object is inactive, all other information in the row is to be considered invalid.

When active(1), the information is valid and represents the current peer of the OAM entity. When inactive(2), the information in this row is invalid. A value of inactive(2) is returned if the h3cDot3OamOperStatus is disabled, passiveWait, or activeSendLocal. For all other values of h3cDot3OamOperStatus, a value of active(1) is returned.

Ethernet OAM on this interface must not use OAMPDUs that exceed this size. The maximum OAMPDU size can be determined from the PDU Configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer.

This attribute is changed by the peer whenever it has a local configuration change for Ethernet OAM this interface. This value is initialized to all zeros (0x00000000), and is invalid if the h3cDot3OamPeerStatus is inactive. The configuration revision can be determined from the Revision field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. An Information OAMPDU is indicated by a valid frame with (1) destination MAC address equal to that of the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), (2) a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, (3) a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for OAM, and (4) a OAM code that equals the code reserved for Information OAMPDUs.

Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) are echoed back over the same interface on which they were received. In this state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface. Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal data flow and should be used accordingly. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.10.2.42.3.1.3.1,A3COM-HUAWEI-EFM-COMMON-MIB::h3cDot3OamLoopbackEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing information on the loopback status for a single Ethernet like interface.

Writing startRemoteLoopback(2) to this attribute cause the local OAM client to send a loopback OAMPDU to the OAM peer with the loopback enable flags set. Writing stopRemoteLoopback(3) to this attribute will cause the local OAM client to send a loopback OAMPDU to the OAM peer with the loopback enable flags cleared. Writing noLoopback to this attribute has no effect. Writes to this attribute are ignored unless the OAM status of this interface is 'operational' (h3cDot3OamOperStatus). The attribute always returns noLoopback on a read. To determine the loopback status, use the attribute h3cDot3OamLoopbackStatus. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.45.1.10.2.42.3.1.3.1.2,A3COM-HUAWEI-EFM-COMMON-MIB::h3cDot3OamLoopbackStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,noLoopback(1):initiatingLoopback(2):remoteLoopback(3):terminatingLoopback(4):localLoopback(5):unknown(6),The loopback status of the OAM entity. This status is determined by a combination of the local parser and multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states, as well as by the actions of the local OAM client. When operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the status reads noLoopback(1). If the OAM client has sent an Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'. In this case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any acknowledgement that the remote OAM entity has received its loopback command request. If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in loopback mode (via the remote state information as described in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is remoteLoopback(3). If the local OAM client is in the process of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3, 30.3.6.1.14], with its local multiplexer and parser states in DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4). If the remote OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as indicated by its local parser state, the status is localLoopback(5). The unknown(6) status indicates the parser and multiplexer combination is unexpected. This status may be returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist. The values of this attribute correspond to the following values of the local and remote parser and multiplexer states. value LclPrsr LclMux RmtPrsr RmtMux noLoopback FWD FWD FWD FWD initLoopback DISCARD DISCARD FWD FWD rmtLoopback DISCARD FWD LPBK DISCARD tmtngLoopback DISCARD DISCARD LPBK DISCARD lclLoopback LPBK DISCARD DISCARD FWD unknown *** any other combination ***

When the value is ignore(1), received loopback commands are ignored. When the value is process(2), OAM loopback commands are processed. The default value is to ignore loopback commands (ignore(1)). The attribute has no meaning if the local OAM entity does not support the loopback function (as defined in h3cDot3OamFunctionsSupported).

The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment could. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

The value of this object must be set with h3cRrppDomainProtectVlanListLow at the same time when a SET operation is performed. This object is valid only when the value of h3cRrppProtectVlanConfigMode is 'vlan'. If this object is invalid, it does not respond to SET operation, and it returns all '0' bits in response to GET operation.

The agent need not support setting this object to createAndWait or notInService since there are no other writable objects in this table, and writable objects in rows of corresponding tables such as the h3cTunnelIfTable may be modified while this row is active. To create a row in this table, the management station should set h3cTunnelInetConfigSlot,  h3cTunnelInetConfigSubSlot, h3cTunnelInetConfigTunnNum,  and set h3cTunnelInetConfigStatus to createAndGo.  Creating a row in this table will cause an interface index to be assigned by the agent in an implementation-dependent manner, and corresponding rows will be instantiated in the ifTable and the h3cTunnelIfTable. The status of this row will become active as soon as the agent assigns the interface index, regardless of whether the interface is operationally up. Deleting a row in this table will likewise delete the corresponding row in the ifTable and in the h3cTunnelIfTable.

The primary mode which the BFD session runs in is known as  Asynchronous mode. In this mode, the systems periodically  send BFD Control packets to one another, and if a number of those packets in a row are not received by the other system,  the session is declared to be down.  The second mode is known as Demand mode. In this mode, it is  assumed that each system has an independent way of verifying  that it has connectivity to the other system. Once a BFD  session is established, the systems stop sending BFD Control  packets, except when either system feels the need to verify  connectivity explicitly, in which case a short sequence of BFD  Control packets is sent, and then the protocol quiesces.  An adjunct to both modes is the Echo function. When the Echo function is active, a stream of BFD Echo packets is transmitted  in such a way as to have the other system loop them back through  its forwarding path. If a number of packets of the echoed data  stream are not received, the session is declared to be down.  The Echo function may be used with either Asynchronous or  Demand modes.  The 'asynchModeWOEchoFun' indicates this BFD session operates in  the Asynchronous mode, and doesn't support the Echo Function.  The 'demandModeWOEchoFunction' indicates this BFD session operates in  the Demand mode, and doesn't support the Echo Function.  The 'asyncModeWEchoFun' indicates this BFD session operates in  the Asynchronous mode, and also supports the Echo Function.  The 'demandModeWEchoFunction' indicates this BFD session operates in  the Demand mode, and also supports the Echo Function.   DEFVAL { asynchModeWOEchoFun }

There are three states through which a session normally  proceeds, two for establishing a session (Init and Up)  and one for tearing down a session (Down.) This allows  a three-way handshake for both session establishment and  session teardown (assuring that both systems are aware of  all session state changes.) A fourth state (AdminDown) exists so that a session can be administratively put down  indefinitely.  The Down state means that the session is down (or has just been  created.) A session remains in Down state until the remote  system indicates that it agrees that the session is down by  sending a BFD Control packet with the State field set to  anything other than Up. If that packet signals Down state,  the session advances to Init state; if that packet signals  Init state, the session advances to Up state.  Init state means that the remote system is 0communicating,  and the local system desires to bring the session up, but  the remote system does not yet realize it. A session will  remain in Init state until either a BFD Control Packet is  received that is signaling Init or Up state (in which case  the session advances to Up state) or until the detection time  expires, meaning that communication with the remote system  has been lost (in which case the session advances to Down state.) Up state means that the BFD session has successfully been established, and implies that connectivity between the systems  is working. The session will remain in the Up state until either  connectivity fails, or the session is taken down administratively. If either the remote system signals Down state, or the detection  time expires, the session advances to Down state. AdminDown state means that the session is being held  administratively down. This causes the remote system to enter  Down state, and remain there until the local system exits  AdminDown state.   DEFVAL { down }

Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. Fat AP Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could independently work without help from AC. Fit AP Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work under the control and management from AC. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. Basic Service Set The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. It will be identified by BSSID.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Fat AP Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could work independently without help from AC. Fit AP Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work under the control and management from AC. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. Association The service used to establish access point or station mapping and enable STA invocation of the distribution system services. (Wireless clients attempt to connect to access points.) Basic Rate A data rate that is mandatory for client devices to support in order for them to achieve successful association.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associated with the AP. station (Client Station) A wireless device in a wireless network associated with an access point. MIC Message Integrity Check. A MIC can, optionally, be added to WEP-encrypted 802.11 frames. SSID Radio Service Set ID. It is used for identification during association. STA (WSTA) A non-AP 802.11 wireless station. WEP Wired Equivalent Privacy. 'WEP' is generally used to refer to 802.11 encryption. RSSI It is the received signal strength indication. It suggests the quality of received signal. RTS Request to Send, it is used to gain control of the medium for the transmission of 'large' frames, in which 'large' is defined by the RTS threshold in the network card driver. CTS Clear to Send, it is used to answer RTS frames. AKM The authentication and key management method defined by 802.11i, and which includes 802.1x and pre-shared key.

Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. Fat AP Applied in the home, SOHO and so on, and it could work independently without help from AC. Fit AP Applied in the enterprise environment, it will work under the control and management from AC. Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol The short name of protocol is CAPWAP. AC will control and manage AP by CAPWAP tunnel protocol defined by IETF. Also, a data tunnel will be set up between AC and AP. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. Association The service used to establish access point or station mapping and enable station invocation of the distribution system services. (Wireless clients attempt to connect to access points.) Basic Rate A data rate that is mandatory for client devices to support in order for them to achieve successful association. MSDU MAC Service Data Unit, it is frame format defined by 802.11. TU It is 1,024 microseconds (ms), which is about 1 millisecond. AKM The authentication and key management method defined by 802.11i, and which includes 802.1x and pre-shared key.

GLOSSARY Wireless Intrusion Detection Sensor (WIDS) WIDS is designed to be employed in an area that is serviced by an existing wireless network. It aids in the early detection of malicious outsider attacks and intrusions via wireless networks. Rogue AP A rogue access point is any Wi-Fi access point connected to the network without authorization. As it is not authorized, if there is any weakness in the AP, the hacker will have chance to compromise the network. Rogue Station It is similiar to Rogue AP, while it is a station. Monitor AP An AP will scan or listen to the air, and try to detect wireless attack in the network. Some AP products will work only in monitor role, while some AP products could switch between normal AP role (only provide wireless access service)and monitor AP role. Ad Hoc Mode Station could work under Ad hoc mode, then they could directly do peer-to-peer communication without other device support.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. WMM WMM is a wireless QoS protocol designed to preferentially transmit packets with high priority, thus guaranteeing better QoS services for voice and video applications in a wireless network. EDCA Enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) is a channel contention mechanism designed by WMM to preferentially transmit packets with high priority and allocate more bandwidth to such packets. AC Access category (AC), is used for channel contention. WMM defines four access categories; they are AC-VO (voice), AC-VI (video), AC-BE (best-effort), and AC-BK (background) in the descending order of priority. When contending for a channel, a high-priority AC preempts a low-priority AC. CAC Connection admission control (CAC) limits the number of clients that are using high-priority ACs (AC-VO and AC-VI) to guarantee sufficient bandwidth for existing high-priority traffic. U-APSD Unscheduled automatic power-save delivery (U-APSD) is a new power saving mechanism defined by WMM to enhance the power saving capability of clients. SVP SpectraLink voice priority (SVP) is a voice priority protocol designed by the Spectralink company to guarantee QoS for voice traffic.

GLOSSARY IEEE 802.11 Standard to encourage interoperability among wireless networking equipment. Access point (AP) Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device that commonly connects and transports data between a wireless network and a wired network. Access control (AC) To control and manage multi-APs, it will bridge wireless and wired network. BSS IEEE 802.11 Basic Service Set (Radio Cell). The BSS of an AP comprises of the stations directly associating with the AP. Radio The chip set to receive and send wireless signal. HA The AC to which a wireless station is connected by associating with an AP for the first time is the HA of the station. FA An AC that is other than the HA and to which a station is currently connected is an FA of the station. Fast-roam capable station A wireless station which directly associates to a fast-roam service (rsn+dot1X) with one AC for the first time. Roam-out station A wireless station which has associated with an AC other than the HA in the mobility-group is referred to as a roam-out station at its HA. Roam-in station A wireless station which has associated with an AC other than the HA in the mobility-group is referred to as a roam-in station at the FA. Intra-AC roaming A procedure where a wireless station roams from one AP to another AP, which are connected to the same AC. Inter-AC roaming A procedure where a wireless station roams from one AP to another AP, which are connected to different ACs. Inter-AC fast roaming capability If a station uses 802.1x (RSN) authentication through negotiation, this station has inter-AC fast roaming capability. WLAN-tunnel One type of layer 2 interface which is bound with an IACTP data tunnel and used to tunnel unicast/broadcast frames between ACs.

So it is triggered by significative IP address change. Suppose that two management interfaces on a device, Interface-A and Interface-B. Initially both interfaces are down and assigned no IP address. Configure Interface-A as the primary monitored interface, Interface-B as the secondary. Significative IP address change in following cases: 1. If Interface-A is assigned an IP address primarily, and it is linking up, then Interface-B will be ignored. A notification will be triggered, appending IP address of Interface-A. 2. If Interface-B is assigned an IP address primarily, and it is linking up, then Interface-A will be ignored. A notification will be triggered, appending IP address of Interface-B. 3. If IP address of that interface, which had its IP address announced to NMS, is changed since last notification triggered, then another notification will be sent to NMS. 4. Suppore that Interface-A was linked up and assigned an IP address primarily. If for some unknown reason, Interface-A is down or loses IP address, and Interface-B is assigned an IP address which is different with that announced to NMS before, then a notification will be triggered, appending the new IP address that Interface-B assigned. 5. A notification appending new IP address that Interface-A assigned will be triggered, if 4 occurs to Interface-B.

While VFCs can be dynamically created based on FIP FLOGI/ELP requests, operators may want to associate certain pre-configured policy for a particular ENode or a remote-FCF. In such cases static VFC creation becomes necessary. In addition to being creating, a static VFC also needs to be associated to an ENode or remote-FCF. The VFC binding provides such an associaton. The binding does not need to be specified when the row for a VFC is created, but may be specified later.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.3,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object contains a transport address. The format of this address depends on the value of the snmpTargetAddrTDomain object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.4,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTimeout,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,This object should reflect the expected maximum round trip time for communicating with the transport address defined by this row. When a message is sent to this address, and a response (if one is expected) is not received within this time period, an implementation may assume that the response will not be delivered. Note that the time interval that an application waits for a response may actually be derived from the value of this object. The method for deriving the actual time interval is implementation dependent. One such method is to derive the expected round trip time based on a particular retransmission algorithm and on the number of timeouts which have occurred. The type of message may also be considered when deriving expected round trip times for retransmissions. For example, if a message is being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both authentication and privacy, the derived value may be increased to compensate for extra processing time spent during authentication and encryption processing.
