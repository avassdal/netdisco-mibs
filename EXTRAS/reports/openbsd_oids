.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,SNMPv2-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,current,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,IF-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of packets, delivered by this sub-layer to a higher (sub-)layer, which were addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.17,IF-MIB::ifOutUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets that higher-level protocols requested be transmitted, and which were not addressed to a multicast or broadcast address at this sub-layer, including those that were discarded or not sent. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4,IP-MIB::ip,,,,,,

IPv4 routers forward datagrams. IPv4 hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). When this object is written, the entity should save the change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,IP-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IPv4 header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol. When this object is written, the entity should save the change to non-volatile storage and restore the object from non-volatile storage upon re-initialization of the system. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.3,IP-MIB::ipInReceives,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of input datagrams received from interfaces, including those received in error.

It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInHdrErrors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,IP-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IPv4 address in their IPv4 header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IPv4 routers, and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInAddrErrors.

In entities which do not act as IPv4 routers, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source-Route option processing was successful. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInForwDatagrams.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,IP-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.

Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly. This object has been deprecated, as a new IP version-neutral table has been added. It is loosely replaced by ipSystemStatsInDiscards.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9,IP-MIB::ipInDelivers,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of input datagrams successfully delivered to IPv4 user-protocols (including ICMP).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaIfIndex,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex. This object predates the rule limiting index objects to a max access value of 'not-accessible' and so continues to use a value of 'read-create'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaPhysAddress,OCTET,read-create,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. This object should return 0 when this entry is in the 'incomplete' state. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.3,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaNetAddress,IpAddress,read-create,,deprecated,,The IpAddress corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address. This object predates the rule limiting index objects to a max access value of 'not-accessible' and so continues to use a value of 'read-create'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.4,IP-MIB::ipNetToMediaType,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dis-associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation- specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity should not save the change to non-volatile storage. Note: a stronger requirement is not used because this object was previously defined.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,IP-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries. This object was defined in pre-IPv6 versions of the IP MIB. It was implicitly IPv4 only, but the original specifications did not indicate this protocol restriction. In order to clarify the specifications, this object has been deprecated and a similar, but more thoroughly clarified, object has been added to the IP-FORWARD-MIB.

This object may not take a Multicast (Class D) address value. Any assignment (implicit or otherwise) of an instance of this object to a value x must be rejected if the bitwise logical-AND of x with the value of the corresponding instance of the ipForwardMask object is not equal to x.

Note that local(3) refers to a route for which the next hop is the final destination; remote(4) refers to a route for which the next hop is not the final destination. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipForwardTable object. That is, it effectively disassociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.

This table primarily provides support for IPv6 prefixes, and several of the objects are less meaningful for IPv4. The table continues to allow IPv4 addresses to allow future flexibility. In order to promote a common configuration, this document includes suggestions for default values for IPv4 prefixes. Each of these values may be overridden if an object is meaningful to the node. All prefixes used by this entity should be included in this table independent of how the entity learned the prefix. (This table isn't limited to prefixes learned from router advertisements.)
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixEntry,,not-accessible,ipAddressPrefixIfIndex:ipAddressPrefixType:ipAddressPrefixPrefix:ipAddressPrefixLength,current,,An entry in the ipAddressPrefixTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface on which this prefix is configured. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.2,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of ipAddressPrefix.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.3,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixPrefix,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The address prefix. The address type of this object is specified in ipAddressPrefixType. The length of this object is the standard length for objects of that type (4 or 16 bytes). Any bits after ipAddressPrefixLength must be zero. Implementors need to be aware that, if the size of ipAddressPrefixPrefix exceeds 114 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.4,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixLength,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The prefix length associated with this prefix. The value 0 has no special meaning for this object. It simply refers to address '::/0'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.5,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixOrigin,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):manual(2):wellknown(3):dhcp(4):routeradv(5),The origin of this prefix.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.6,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixOnLinkFlag,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has the value 'true(1)', if this prefix can be used for on-link determination; otherwise, the value is 'false(2)'. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 'true(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.7,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAutonomousFlag,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),Autonomous address configuration flag. When true(1), indicates that this prefix can be used for autonomous address configuration (i.e., can be used to form a local interface address). If false(2), it is not used to auto- configure a local interface address. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 'false(2)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.8,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAdvPreferredLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be preferred, i.e., time until deprecation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from a deprecated prefix should no longer be used as a source address in new communications, but packets received on such an interface are processed as expected. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 4,294,967,295 (infinity).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.32.1.9,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefixAdvValidLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this prefix will continue to be valid, i.e., time until invalidation. A value of 4,294,967,295 represents infinity. The address generated from an invalidated prefix should not appear as the destination or source address of a packet. The default for IPv4 prefixes is 4,294,967,295 (infinity).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.33,IP-MIB::ipAddressSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP managers to coordinate their use of the set operation in creating or modifying rows within this table. In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipAddressTableSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command, including the retrieved value of ipAddressSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipAddressSpinLock will have changed, and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipAddressSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipAddressSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34,IP-MIB::ipAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains addressing information relevant to the entity's interfaces. This table does not contain multicast address information. Tables for such information should be contained in multicast specific MIBs, such as RFC 3019. While this table is writable, the user will note that several objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, are not. The intention in allowing a user to write to this table is to allow them to add or remove any entry that isn't permanent. The user should be allowed to modify objects and entries when that would not cause inconsistencies within the table. Allowing write access to objects, such as ipAddressOrigin, could allow a user to insert an entry and then label it incorrectly. Note well: When including IPv6 link-local addresses in this table, the entry must use an InetAddressType of 'ipv6z' in order to differentiate between the possible interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressEntry,,not-accessible,ipAddressAddrType:ipAddressAddr,current,,An address mapping for a particular interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.1,IP-MIB::ipAddressAddrType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The address type of ipAddressAddr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.2,IP-MIB::ipAddressAddr,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP address to which this entry's addressing information pertains. The address type of this object is specified in ipAddressAddrType. Implementors need to be aware that if the size of ipAddressAddr exceeds 116 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.3,IP-MIB::ipAddressIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.4,IP-MIB::ipAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,unicast(1):anycast(2):broadcast(3),The type of address. broadcast(3) is not a valid value for IPv6 addresses (RFC 3513).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.5,IP-MIB::ipAddressPrefix,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,A pointer to the row in the prefix table to which this address belongs. May be { 0 0 } if there is no such row.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.6,IP-MIB::ipAddressOrigin,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):manual(2):dhcp(4):linklayer(5):random(6),The origin of the address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.7,IP-MIB::ipAddressStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,preferred(1):deprecated(2):invalid(3):inaccessible(4):unknown(5):tentative(6):duplicate(7):optimistic(8),The status of the address, describing if the address can be used for communication. In the absence of other information, an IPv4 address is always preferred(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.8,IP-MIB::ipAddressCreated,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was created. If this entry was created prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.9,IP-MIB::ipAddressLastChanged,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last updated. If this entry was updated prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.10,IP-MIB::ipAddressRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. The RowStatus TC requires that this DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances other objects in this row can be modified. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. A conceptual row can not be made active until the ipAddressIfIndex has been set to a valid index.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.34.1.11,IP-MIB::ipAddressStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),The storage type for this conceptual row. If this object has a value of 'permanent', then no other objects are required to be able to be modified.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The IP Address Translation table used for mapping from IP addresses to physical addresses. The Address Translation tables contain the IP address to 'physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries. While many protocols may be used to populate this table, ARP and Neighbor Discovery are the most likely options.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,ipNetToPhysicalIfIndex:ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType:ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress,current,,Each entry contains one IP address to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.1,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which this entry is applicable. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.2,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalNetAddressType,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),The type of ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.3,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP Address corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address. The address type of this object is specified in ipNetToPhysicalAddressType. Implementors need to be aware that if the size of ipNetToPhysicalNetAddress exceeds 115 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.4,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The media-dependent `physical' address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.5,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalLastUpdated,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last updated. If this entry was updated prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.6,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):invalid(2):dynamic(3):static(4):local(5),The type of mapping. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToPhysicalTable. That is, it effectively dis- associates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToPhysicalType object. The 'dynamic(3)' type indicates that the IP address to physical addresses mapping has been dynamically resolved using e.g., IPv4 ARP or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol. The 'static(4)' type indicates that the mapping has been statically configured. Both of these refer to entries that provide mappings for other entities addresses. The 'local(5)' type indicates that the mapping is provided for an entity's own interface address. As the entries in this table are typically not persistent when this object is written the entity SHOULD NOT save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.7,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalState,INTEGER,read-only,,current,reachable(1):stale(2):delay(3):probe(4):invalid(5):unknown(6):incomplete(7),The Neighbor Unreachability Detection state for the interface when the address mapping in this entry is used. If Neighbor Unreachability Detection is not in use (e.g. for IPv4), this object is always unknown(6).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.35.1.8,IP-MIB::ipNetToPhysicalRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this conceptual row. The RowStatus TC requires that this DESCRIPTION clause states under which circumstances other objects in this row can be modified. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified. A conceptual row can not be made active until the ipNetToPhysicalPhysAddress object has been set. Note that if the ipNetToPhysicalType is set to 'invalid', the managed node may delete the entry independent of the state of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.36,IP-MIB::ipv6ScopeZoneIndexTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table used to describe IPv6 unicast and multicast scope zones. For those objects that have names rather than numbers, the names were chosen to coincide with the names used in the IPv6 address architecture document.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.36.1.1,IP-MIB::ipv6ScopeZoneIndexIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface to which these scopes belong. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.36.1.2,IP-MIB::ipv6ScopeZoneIndexLinkLocal,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The zone index for the link-local scope on this interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.2,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The IP address of the default router represented by this row. The address type of this object is specified in ipDefaultRouterAddressType. Implementers need to be aware that if the size of ipDefaultRouterAddress exceeds 115 octets, then OIDS of instances of columns in this row will have more than 128 sub-identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.3,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface by which the router can be reached. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of the IF-MIB's ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.4,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterLifetime,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The remaining length of time, in seconds, that this router will continue to be useful as a default router. A value of zero indicates that it is no longer useful as a default router. It is left to the implementer of the MIB as to whether a router with a lifetime of zero is removed from the list. For IPv6, this value should be extracted from the router advertisement messages.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.37.1.5,IP-MIB::ipDefaultRouterPreference,INTEGER,read-only,,current,reserved(-2):low(-1):medium(0):high(1),An indication of preference given to this router as a default router as described in he Default Router Preferences document. Treating the value as a 2 bit signed integer allows for simple arithmetic comparisons. For IPv4 routers or IPv6 routers that are not using the updated router advertisement format, this object is set to medium (0).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.38,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,An advisory lock used to allow cooperating SNMP managers to coordinate their use of the set operation in creating or modifying rows within this table. In order to use this lock to coordinate the use of set operations, managers should first retrieve ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. They should then determine the appropriate row to create or modify. Finally, they should issue the appropriate set command including the retrieved value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. If another manager has altered the table in the meantime, then the value of ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock will have changed and the creation will fail as it will be specifying an incorrect value for ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock. It is suggested, but not required, that the ipv6RouterAdvertSpinLock be the first var bind for each set of objects representing a 'row' in a PDU.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.39,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information used to construct router advertisements.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.39.1,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertEntry,,not-accessible,ipv6RouterAdvertIfIndex,current,,An entry containing information used to construct router advertisements. Information in this table is persistent, and when this object is written, the entity SHOULD save the change to non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.39.1.1,IP-MIB::ipv6RouterAdvertIfIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value that uniquely identifies the interface on which router advertisements constructed with this information will be transmitted.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.

Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2). SNMP engines on bridges supporting a large number of ports must support appropriate maximum message sizes.

An entry shall be placed in the storage table for each logical area of storage that is allocated and has fixed resource limits. The amount of storage represented in an entity is the amount actually usable by the requesting entity, and excludes loss due to formatting or file system reference information. These entries are associated with logical storage areas, as might be seen by an application, rather than physical storage entities which are typically seen by an operating system. Storage such as tapes and floppies without file systems on them are typically not allocated in chunks by the operating system to requesting applications, and therefore shouldn't appear in this table. Examples of valid storage for this table include disk partitions, file systems, ram (for some architectures this is further segmented into regular memory, extended memory, and so on), backing store for virtual memory (`swap space'). This table is intended to be a useful diagnostic for `out of memory' and `out of buffers' types of failures. In addition, it can be a useful performance monitoring tool for tracking memory, disk, or buffer usage.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media.

On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.

If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTableLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable.
