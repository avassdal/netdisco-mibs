.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software. It is mandatory that this only contain printable ASCII characters.

This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,RFC1213-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity primarily offers. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero, Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs primarily routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., IP gateways) 4 end-to-end (e.g., IP hosts) 7 applications (e.g., mail relays) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,RFC1213-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,mandatory,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,RFC1213-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,The interface's address at the protocol layer immediately `below' the network layer in the protocol stack.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,RFC1213-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,mandatory,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re- initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,RFC1213-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.11,RFC1213-MIB::ifInUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of subnetwork-unicast packets delivered to a higher-layer protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.12,RFC1213-MIB::ifInNUcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of non-unicast (i.e., subnetwork- broadcast or subnetwork-multicast) packets delivered to a higher-layer protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,RFC1213-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.

For example, if the interface is realized by an ethernet, then the value of this object refers to a document defining objects specific to ethernet. If this information is not present, its value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }, which is a syntatically valid object identifier, and any conformant implementation of ASN.1 and BER must be able to generate and recognize this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.4,RFC1213-MIB::ipInHdrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.5,RFC1213-MIB::ipInAddrErrors,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams discarded because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space). Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded while awaiting re-assembly.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDelivers,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of input datagrams successfully delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.10,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutRequests,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The total number of IP datagrams which local IP user-protocols (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission. Note that this counter does not include any datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of seconds which received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of failures detected by the IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragOKs,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.18,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Don't Fragment flag was set.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.19,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragCreates,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagram fragments that have been generated as a result of fragmentation at this entity.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant ipNetToMediaType object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.23,RFC1213-MIB::ipRoutingDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of routing entries which were chosen to be discarded even though they are valid. One possible reason for discarding such an entry could be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection.

This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [4,6], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RFC1271-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControl entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RFC1271-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControl entry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media-specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RFC1271-MIB::historyControlInterval,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControl entry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table.

Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RFC1271-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-write,,mandatory,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RFC1271-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-write,,mandatory,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RFC1271-MIB::filterPktStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this object, filterPktStatus this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in [4,6]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RFC1271-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters.

The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RFC1271-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RFC1271-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,mandatory,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlIndex,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RFC1271-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RFC1271-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RFC1271-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.10,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this protocol directory entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this protocolDistControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this row. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13,RMON2-MIB::addressMap,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this entry in the addressMapControlTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for this addressMapControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this addressMap control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time this entry was last created or the values of the physical address changed. This can be used to help detect duplicate address problems, in which case this object will be updated frequently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14,RMON2-MIB::nlHost,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlHostControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlHostTable, and optionally in the alHostTable, on behalf of this hlHostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the associated host tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated nlHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been deleted from the nlHost table (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the nlHostTable on behalf of this control entry. The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.7,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlAlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for the associated alHost entries for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alHostTable is not implemented or is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.8,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlAlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an alHost entry has been inserted into the alHost table.

To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time.

This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.11,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2,RMON2-MIB::nlHostTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular network layer address that has been discovered on an interface of this device. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirHostConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirHostConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all addresses seen as the source or destination address in all packets with no MAC errors, and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1,RMON2-MIB::nlHostEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex:nlHostTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:nlHostAddress,current,,A conceptual row in the nlHostTable. The hlHostControlIndex value in the index identifies the hlHostControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The protocolDirLocalIndex value in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the nlHostAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is nlHostOutPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::nlHostTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::nlHostAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this nlHostEntry. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::nlHostInPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets without errors transmitted to this address since it was added to the nlHostTable. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlHostOutPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets without errors transmitted by this address since it was added to the nlHostTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::nlHostOutMacNonUnicastPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets without errors transmitted by this address that were directed to any MAC broadcast addresses or to any MAC multicast addresses since this host was added to the nlHostTable. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlHostCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the entry has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) matrix control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level matrix tables containing conversation statistics indexed by pairs of network addresses. Both the network- and application-level matrix tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer matrix records in memory, it can derive network-layer matrix records from them.) Entries in the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alMatrix tables, entries in the alMatrix tables will be created on behalf of each entry in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlMatrixControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlMatrixControlTable. An example of indexing of this entry is hlMatrixControlNlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hlMatrixControlTable. Each such entry defines a function that discovers conversations on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the nlMatrixSDTable and the nlMatrixDSTable, and optionally the alMatrixSDTable and alMatrixDSTable, on behalf of this hlMatrixControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of the data for the associated matrix tables. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlMatrixTables are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been inserted into the nlMatrix tables. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The addition of a conversation into both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two insertions (even though every addition into one table must be accompanied by an insertion into the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the sum of then nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable sizes can be determined by subtracting hlMatrixControlNlDeletes from hlMatrixControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlMatrix entry has been deleted from the nlMatrix tables (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The deletion of a conversation from both the nlMatrixSDTable and nlMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two deletions (even though every deletion from one table must be accompanied by a deletion from the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlMatrixControlNlDeletes from hlMatrixControlNlInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlNlMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the nlMatrix tables on behalf of this control entry. The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alMatrixTables are not implemented or are inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.1.1.8,RMON2-MIB::hlMatrixControlAlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an alMatrix entry has been inserted into the alMatrix tables. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The addition of a conversation into both the alMatrixSDTable and alMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two insertions (even though every addition into one table must be accompanied by an insertion into the other). To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time.

If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. The deletion of a conversation from both the alMatrixSDTable and alMatrixDSTable shall be counted as two deletions (even though every deletion from one table must be accompanied by a deletion from the other).

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlMatrixControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified.

This table is indexed first by the source address and then by the destination address to make it convenient to collect all conversations from a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all pairs of addresses seen in all packets with no MAC errors and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors. Further, this table will only contain entries that have a corresponding entry in the nlMatrixDSTable with the same source address and destination address.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the nlMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate or nlMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.

When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated alMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the alMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there.

When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.7,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this variable history control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the usrHistoryTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A list of MIB instances to be sampled periodically. Entries in this table are created when an associated usrHistoryControlObjects object is created. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index is that of the associated usrHistoryControlEntry. For example, an instance of usrHistoryObjectVariable might be usrHistoryObjectVariable.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19,RMON2-MIB::probeConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.1,RMON2-MIB::probeCapabilities,BITS,read-only,,current,etherStats(0):historyControl(1):etherHistory(2):alarm(3):hosts(4):hostTopN(5):matrix(6):filter(7):capture(8):event(9):tokenRingMLStats(10):tokenRingPStats(11):tokenRingMLHistory(12):tokenRingPHistory(13):ringStation(14):ringStationOrder(15):ringStationConfig(16):sourceRouting(17):protocolDirectory(18):protocolDistribution(19):addressMapping(20):nlHost(21):nlMatrix(22):alHost(23):alMatrix(24):usrHistory(25):probeConfig(26),An indication of the RMON MIB groups supported on at least one interface by this probe.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to '0.0.0.0' when no IP address has been specified.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.8,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadAction,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notDownloading(1):downloadToPROM(2):downloadToRAM(3),When this object is set to downloadToRAM(3) or downloadToPROM(2), the device will discontinue its normal operation and begin download of the image specified by probeDownloadFile from the server specified by probeDownloadTFTPServer using the TFTP protocol. If downloadToRAM(3) is specified, the new image is copied to RAM only (the old image remains unaltered in the flash EPROM). If downloadToPROM(2) is specified, the new image is written to the flash EPROM memory after its checksum has been verified to be correct. When the download process is completed, the device will warm boot to restart the newly loaded application. When the device is not downloading, this object will have a value of notDownloading(1). This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.

If either the netConfigIPAddress or netConfigSubnetMask is 0.0.0.0, then when the device boots, it may use BOOTP to try to figure out what these values should be. If BOOTP fails before the device can talk on the network, this value must be configured (e.g., through a terminal attached to the device). If BOOTP is used, care should be taken to not send BOOTP broadcasts too frequently and to eventually send them very infrequently if no replies are received.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

A row creation operation in this table for an entry with a local VlanIndex value may fail if the current value of this object is not used as the index. Even if the value read is used, there is no guarantee that it will still be the valid index when the create operation is attempted; another manager may have already got in during the intervening time interval. In this case, dot1qNextFreeLocalVlanIndex should be re-read and the creation re-tried with the new value. This value will automatically change when the current value is used to create a new row.

The value enabled(1) indicates that GVRP is enabled on this port, as long as dot1qGvrpStatus is also enabled for this device. When disabled(2) but dot1qGvrpStatus is still enabled for the device, GVRP is disabled on this port: any GVRP packets received will be silently discarded, and no GVRP registrations will be propagated from other ports. This object affects all GVRP Applicant and Registrar state machines on this port. A transition from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will cause a reset of all GVRP state machines on this port. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system.

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read.

A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.37.1.6,ATM-MIB::atmVplTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The Virtual Path Link (VPL) table. A bi-directional VPL is modeled as one entry in this table.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.37.1.6.1,ATM-MIB::atmVplEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:atmVplVpi,current,,An entry in the VPL table. This entry is used to model a bi-directional VPL. To create a VPL at an ATM interface, either of the following procedures are used: Negotiated VPL establishment (1) The management application creates a VPL entry in the atmVplTable by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5). This may fail for the following reasons: - The selected VPI value is unavailable, - The selected VPI value is in use. Otherwise, the agent creates a row and reserves the VPI value on that port. (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable, thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent ATM traffic parameters and the service category for receive and transmit directions of the VPL. (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists, the manager must create a new row(s) in that table. (2b) The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic parameters through setting the atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values in the VPL table, which point to the rows containing desired ATM traffic parameter values in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable. The agent will check the availability of resources and may refuse the request. If the transmit and receive service categories are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the request. (3) The manager activates the VPL by setting the the atmVplRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources to satisfy the requested traffic parameter values and the service category for that VPL. (4) If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host or switch, the manager turns on the atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL traffic flow on. Otherwise, the atmVpCrossConnectTable must be used to cross-connect the VPL to another VPL(s) in an ATM switch or network. One-Shot VPL Establishment A VPL may also be established in one step by a set-request with all necessary VPL parameter values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one-shot VPL establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step-wise error checking. VPL Retirement A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6), and the agent may release all associated resources.

This entry is used to model a bi-directional ATM VP cross-connect which cross-connects two VPLs. Step-wise Procedures to set up a VP Cross-connect Once the entries in the atmVplTable are created, the following procedures are used to cross-connect the VPLs together. (1) The manager obtains a unique atmVpCrossConnectIndex by reading the atmVpCrossConnectIndexNext object. (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the ATM VP Cross Connect Table, one for each cross-connection between two VPLs. Each row is indexed by the ATM interface port numbers and VPI values of the two ends of that cross-connection. This set of rows specifies the topology of the VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex. Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to createAndWait(5). The agent checks the requested topology and the mutual sanity of the ATM traffic parameters and service categories, i.e., the row creation fails if: - the requested topology is incompatible with associated values of atmVplCastType, - the requested topology is not supported by the agent, - the traffic/service category parameter values associated with the requested row are incompatible with those of already existing rows for this VP cross-connect. [For example, for setting up a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect must equal to the traffic parameters in the transmit direction of the other VPL at the high end of the cross-connect, otherwise, the row creation fails.] The agent also checks for internal errors in building the cross-connect. The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled in by the agent at this point. (2b) The manager promotes the row in the atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources specified by the ATM traffic parameter and Service category values for each direction of the VP cross-connect in an ATM switch or network.

This entry is used to model a bi-directional ATM VC cross-connect cross-connecting two end points. Step-wise Procedures to set up a VC Cross-connect Once the entries in the atmVclTable are created, the following procedures are used to cross-connect the VCLs together to form a VCC segment. (1) The manager obtains a unique atmVcCrossConnectIndex by reading the atmVcCrossConnectIndexNext object. (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the ATM VC Cross Connect Table, one for each cross-connection between two VCLs. Each row is indexed by the ATM interface port numbers and VPI/VCI values of the two ends of that cross-connection. This set of rows specifies the topology of the VCC cross-connect and is identified by a single value of atmVcCrossConnectIndex. Negotiated VC Cross-Connect Establishment (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by setting atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus to createAndWait(5). The agent checks the requested topology and the mutual sanity of the ATM traffic parameters and service categories, i.e., the row creation fails if: - the requested topology is incompatible with associated values of atmVclCastType, - the requested topology is not supported by the agent, - the traffic/service category parameter values associated with the requested row are incompatible with those of already existing rows for this VC cross-connect.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entityPhysical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per physical entity. There is always at least one row for an 'overall' physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical entity. Each entry provides objects (entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalVendorType, and entPhysicalClass) to help an NMS identify and characterize the entry and objects (entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalParentRelPos) to help an NMS relate the particular entry to other entries in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of physical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalVendorType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to an enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device. If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entPhysicalChildIndex,current,,A single container/'containee' relationship.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time a conceptual row is created, modified, or deleted in any of these tables: - entPhysicalTable - entLogicalTable - entLPMappingTable - entAliasMappingTable - entPhysicalContainsTable 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTraps,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.9.1.1.1.2,FAST-ETHERNET-MIB::ctFastEthernetCtlPortGroup,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The port group for which this fast ethernet information pertains.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.9.1.1.1.4,FAST-ETHERNET-MIB::ctFastEthernetLocalTechnologyAbility,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,This indicates the technology ability of the local hardware. The value of this object is the logical OR of all supported  technologies. Where each technology is given the values below: other(1) Undefined, or ability not known Auto-Negotiation(2) Auto-Negotiation 10BASE-T(8) 10BASE-T 10BASE-TFD(16) Full duplex 10BASE-T 100BASE-TX(32) 100BASE-TX  100BASE-TXFD(64) Full Duplex 100BASE-TX 100BASE-T4(128) 100BASE-T4  100BASE-FX(256) 100BASE-FX 100BASE-FXFD(512) Full Duplex 100Base-FX For example a port which supported 100Base-TX(32), 100Base-TXFD(64), and Auto-Negotiation(2) would have a value of 98(32 + 64 + 2).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.9.1.1.1.5,FAST-ETHERNET-MIB::ctFastEthernetCurrentOperationalMode,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,Indicates the current operational mode of this port. The value of this object is the logical OR of current opertational mode and how we arrived at that mode, whether it be by  Auto-Negotiation(2), Manual-Config(4) or default. Where each mode is given the values below: other(1) Initializing or no link, ability unknown Auto-Negotiation(2) Auto-Negotiation/Parallel Detection Manual-Config(4) Manually Configured 10BASE-T(8) 10BASE-T 10BASE-TFD(16) Full duplex 10BASE-T 100BASE-TX(32) 100BASE-TX  100BASE-TXFD(64) Full Duplex 100BASE-TX 100BASE-T4(128) 100BASE-T4 100Base-FX(256) 100Base-FX 100Base-FXFD(512) Full Duplex 100Base-FX For example, a port operating at 100Base-TX(32) achieved through  Auto-Negotiation(2) would have a value of 34(32 + 2). If the port was manually configured(4) for 100Base-TX(32) this object  would have a value of 36(32 + 4). Values written to this object are limited to values read from ctFastEthernetLocalTechnologyAbility, with the addition of Manual-Config(4) but excluding other(1). Therefore if  ctFastEthernetLocalTechnologyAbility has a value of 98 writing a  value of 256 would result in an error. That is to say 100Base-FX  is not supported on this port. A set to a value of Auto-Negotiation(2) will result in auto-negotiation being enabled and will cause link re-negotiation. Note: this re-negotiation will in every case cause temporary link loss  during the link re-negotiation. Any other set with Auto-Negotiation(2) included will result in an error since you can not force an operational mode and auto-negotiation at the same time. A set to a value of Manual-Config(4) will result in auto-negotiation being disabled but the port staying at its current operational mode until device reset/power down at which time the port will come up in default mode. A subsequent read will indicate only the current operational mode achieved by default means. A set to any other value (port is being manually configured) must reflect a single ability. For example writing a value of 68 would result in auto-negotiation being disabled and the port being manually configured(4) for 100Base-TXFD(64). However a write of 100 would result in an error.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.9.1.1.1.6,FAST-ETHERNET-MIB::ctFastEthernetAdvertisedTechnologyAbility,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,Indicates the advertised ability of the local hardware, but only becomes active on ports that have auto-negotiation enabled.  For example a port which will advertise 100Base-TX(32) and 100Base-TXFD(64) ablilities would have a value of 96(32 + 64). A port that does not support auto-negotiation will be read as other(1). Values written to this object are limited to values read from ctFastEthernetLocalTechnologyAbility, excluding other(1) and Auto-Negotiation(2). Therefore if ctFastEthernetLocalTechnologyAbility has a value of 98 writing a value of 128 would result in an error. That is to say 100Base-T4 is not supported on this port. Furthermore, if ctFastEthernetLocalTechnologyAbility has a value that does not include Auto-Negotiation(2), writing any value will result in an error. That is to say that this port does not support Auto-Negotiation and therefore does not support ctFastEthernetAdvertisedTechnologyAbility. A successful set operation will result in immediate link re-negotiation if ctFastEthernetCurrentOperationalMode has a value that includes  Auto-Negotiation(2)(meaning Auto-negotiation is enabled).  Note: this re-negotiation will in every case cause temporary link loss  during the link re-negotiation. If set to a value that is incompatible  with ctFastEthernetReceivedTechnologyAbility, link negotiation will not  be successful and will cause permanent link loss.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.10.1.2.1.1.1.2,CTATM-CONFIG-MIB::ctATMPhyRedundPrimaryPort,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,The physical port number to be used as the primary port. The primary port is the default port to become active and the port of priority, i.e. regardless of the status of the current active port, if the primary can be used (and Redundancy is set up to activate it when it becomes available--see ctATMPhyRedundPrimaryRevert), it will be. The write will NOT take effect immediately. It will wait until the NEXT time that the redundancy algorithm determines that the primary port should be used. This object is persistent. i.e., it will retain its value between powerdowns.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.10.1.2.1.1.1.3,CTATM-CONFIG-MIB::ctATMPhyRedundActivePort,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,The physical port number to be used as the active port. The primary port defaults as the active port if this object is not set. Rules: - This object can always be set when ctATMPhyRedundStatus (q.v.) is set to disable(2). - It cannot be set when ctATMPhyRedundStatus is set to enable(1), ctATMPhyRedundPrimaryRevert (q.v.) is set to automatic(1), and the primary port is deemed good (and therefore usable) by redundancy. Under these conditions, it is meaningless to attempt to manually set the Active Port, as Redundancy would simply reset the active port to the primary again immediately after the set takes place. - If the primary port has failed, or ctATMPhyRedundPrimaryRevert is set to manual(2), then this object can be set; however, the behaviour of redundancy as a result of the set will depend on the status of ctATMPhyRedundActivation (q.v.) and whether or not the port being set active is good. If RedundActivation is enabled, the set may be countermanded immediately if at any time the port being set is found to be bad (and therefore not usable by Redundancy) and another (good) redundant port is available. If RedundActivation is set to manual(2), then the set will take place, regardless of the status of the port being set. Naturally, if the primary port is restored, the behaviour of Redundancy will depend on whether RedundPrimaryRevert is automatic; if it is, the active port will immediately switch over; otherwise it will remain as-is. There is a precisely defined relationship between ctATMPhyRedundActivePort, ctATMPhyRedundStatus, ctATMPhyRedundPrimaryRevert, and ctATMPhyRedundActivation. If RedundStatus is disabled, then PrimaryRevert and RedundActivation have no functional meaning and ActivePort becomes the only means by which the redundant ports can be switched. Likewise, if RedundStatus is enabled and PrimaryRevert is automatic, a set of the ActivePort has no functional meaning for as long as the primary port is deemed usable by redundancy. If RedundStatus is enabled but PrimaryRevert is manual, the active port will only be changed through ActivePort or the exercise of RedundActivation. The line of precedence, therefore, fully depends upon the status of Redundancy; if RedundStatus is disabled, then precedence lies with ActivePort by virtue of the fact that there are no other competing methods to switch the active port among the redundant ports. If RedundStatus is enabled, however, PrimaryRevert (an active switching method) and RedundActivation (a passive switching method) have precedence over ActivePort; if PrimaryRevert is set to automatic, then the active port is immediately switched to the primary as soon as it's deemed usable by Redundancy; likewise, if RedundActivation is set to automatic, the currently active port will be switched immediately in the event of port failure. Clearly, then, ActivePort cannot guarantee a set for as long as any automatic part of Redundancy is enabled. This object is persistent.

The ctPriClassifyDataVal specifies a particular value which, when compared to packet data, is used to classify that packet to a particular priority. The part of the packet (if any), to which this data comparison applies, is determined by this object. For example, the value ipAddressBilateral(8) means that the value ctPriClassifyDataVal for this entry is an IP address. It further means that the given IP address will be compared against both source and destination IP address fields in a packet. Such an entry obviously would not not match against any non-IP packets. Additionally, the value of this leaf will impose certain implicit ranges and interpretations of data contained within the ctPriClassifyDataVal leaf for this entry. The specific limitations of each type should be spelled out in the comments for that type.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.6.1.4.1.3,CTRON-PRIORITY-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctPriClassifyDataVal,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The data value associated with ctPriClassifyDataMeaning. The explicit range of this value is any unsigned 32-bit integer(0..4294967295). This range may vary, however,  depending upon the value of ctPriClassifyDataMeaning. Illegal values should not be allowed.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.6.1.4.1.4,CTRON-PRIORITY-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctPriClassifyDataMask,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,This object is the one's complement of a 32-bit mask. This mask is applicable to the data comparison of ctPriClassifyDataVal. The mask is applied to the actual packet data under consideration through a logical bitwise AND operation. This result is then compared to the data. For example, we want to classify according to a bilateral IP address of 134.141.0.0 with a mask of 255.255.240.0. This would be reflected by the following values: ctPriClassifyDataMeaning: ipAddressBilateral(8) ctPriClassifyDataVal: 0x868d0000 ctPriClassifyDataMask: 0x00000fff Again there are contextual implications for this leaf depending upon the value of ctPriClassifyDataMeaning. Not all types will use the mask, and others will impose restrictions. This value should however be a true indication of the masking operation. In other words, data types that don't use a mask should only allow a value of zero, indicating that all data bits are significant in the comparison. The specific restrictions of each type should be spelled out in the comments for that type. Illegal values should not be allowed.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.6.1.4.1.5,CTRON-PRIORITY-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctPriClassifyIngressList,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The set of ports on which this classification rule applies. Classification occurs on ingress. An agent implementation should allow a set operation of this object to create a row if it does not exist.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.6.1.4.1.6,CTRON-PRIORITY-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctPriClassifyRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This object provides both control and status for the associated conceptual row in the table. Rows can be created in two ways. createAndGo - The specified row will be created and activated if the instance is allowable. If not, an inconsistentValue exception will be returned and the row will not be created. This provides the most optimal method of creating an active row, but provides the user no explanation if the row cannot be created. createAndWait - The specified row will be created and put in the notInService state if the instance is allowable. A subsequent activation of this row will bring it into the active state. If the instance is not allowable, the row will be created and put in the notReady state. A subsequent activation of this row will fail. Since the inappropriate information is always contained in the indexing leaves, activation will never succeed and the row should be removed by the management station. When a row is in the notReady state, the ctPriClassifyRowInfo may be retrieved to obtain a plain English explanation of why this row cannot be activated. createAndWait is the preferred method for this reason.  Both methods described above leave ctPriClassifyIngressList in it's default state, requiring an additional set operation in order to modify it. An even more optimal twist on the createAndWait method is to set the ctPriClassifyIngressList to it's desired value as a method for row creation. This will essentially cause an implicit createAndWait since it too will leave the row in either the notInService or notReady state. This leaves only activation or error analysis as the last step. Any rows left in the notReady or notInService state for more than 5 minutes should be automatically removed by the agent implementation.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.6.1.4.1.7,CTRON-PRIORITY-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctPriClassifyRowInfo,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object provides info about this row in the form of an ASCII string, suitable for display purposes. The intended purpose of this object is to provide an 'agent-specific' explanation as to why the ctPriClassifyRowStatus for this conceptual row is in the 'notReady' state. A management station should read this object and display it to the user in this case. A conceptual row that does not fall into this category may simply return a single NULL, but may also provide any useful info of its choice. A management station may attempt to display such info if it so chooses, but is under no burden to do so.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.6.1.4.1.8,CTRON-PRIORITY-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctPriClassifyTOSStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enable(1):disable(2),This object indicates whether an IP Type Of Service (TOS) value, defined by ctPriClassifyTOSValue, should be written into the TOS field of the IP header for any packet matching the classification specified by this conceptual row. This object may be set to enable only for the conceptual rows whose ctPriClassifyDataMeaning and ctPriClassifyDataVal have the following values: ctPriClassifyDataMeaning ctPriClassifyDataVal ------------------------ -------------------- etherType(1) 0x0800 (IP) llcDsapSsap(2) 0x0606 (IP) ipTypeOfService(3) any ipProtocolType(4) any ipAddressSource(7) any ipAddressDestination(8) any ipAddressBilateral(9) any ipUdpPortSource(13) any ipUdpPortDestination(14) any ipUdpPortBilateral(15) any ipTdpPortSource(16) any ipTdpPortDestination(17) any ipTdpPortBilateral(18) any ipFrag(25) not applicable A conceptual row that does not fall into these categories may be set to disable(2) and will return disable(2).

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.14.7.1.3,CTRON-RATE-POLICING-MIB::ctRatePolicingConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table allows configuration of rate policing rules on this device. Their are a limited number of resources available for rate policing, and this directly limits the number of rate policing rules that may be configured on each port. As a result this table does not support dynamic row creation, rather, all possible rows exist in either an active or disabled state. A manager application should not, however, infer that this configuration is necessarily fixed during the lifetime of the managed entity. The allocation of resources could theoretically be shifted. For example port 20 could have 3 resources and at some point suddenly have 4 or 2. Any such change would of course cause the value of ctRatePolicingConfigLastChange to change. At this time their is no defined mechanism to move these resources and there very likely never will be. This is merely a warning that manager applications should not count on this.

An X in a box represents that the bit is considered significant based on the value of M. 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 +===============================================+ M=0 | | | | | | | | | | | | | +===============================================+ 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 +===============================================+ M=4 | | | | | | | | | X | X | X | X | +===============================================+ 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 +===============================================+ M=9 | | | | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | +===============================================+ Significant bits are assigned sequentially starting with bit zero and ending with bit M-1. For a set value of M, (2 ^ M) VLAN groups will be created. Each group will contain (2 ^ (12 - M)) VLAN Ids, with the exception of the first group and last group which will each have ((2 ^ (12 - M)) - 1) VLAN Ids (VLAN Ids 0 and 4095 are reserved). VLAN groups are numbered sequentially from 0 through ((2 ^ M) - 1). The VLAN Ids assigned to each group, N, are assigned sequentially starting with (N * (2 ^ (12 - M))) through ((N * (2 ^ (12 - M))) + ((2 ^ (12 - M)) - 1)), with the exception of group zero which always starts with VLAN Id 1 and group ((2 ^ M) -1) which always ends with VLAN Id 4094. The number of bits specified allows the maximum amount of flexibility in the scoping of traffic, without compromising security between VLANS. For example, a set value of 0 would create a single VLAN group with 4094 VLAN Ids. This configuration would allow all unicast traffic to be bridged between VLANS, while scoping all multicast and broadcast traffic to a specific VLAN. A set value of 12 would restrict all unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic to a specific VLAN. In this configuration no traffic would be bridged between VLANS. Setting of this object is limited to devices which support configurable(2) operational modes as specified by ctVlanSupportedOperationalMode. A set of this object for a device which only supports static(1) operational mode will fail. A read of this object for a device that only supports static(1) operational mode will always return 12.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.1.6.1.2,CTRON-VLAN-EXTENSIONS-MIB::ctVlanSupportedPortNum,OCTET,read-only,,mandatory,,The set of ports on the device, specified by ctVlanSupportedSlotNum, that support VLANs. Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the VLAN bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1' then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.1.7,CTRON-VLAN-EXTENSIONS-MIB::ctVlanLearningMode,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,ivl(1):svl(2):svlivl(3),This value indicates the type of VLAN learning the device supports. A value of ivl(1) indicates the device supports Independent VLAN Learning (IVL). Configuration and operation of the Learning Process and the Filtering Database such that, for a given set of VLANs, if a given individual MAC address is learnt in one VLAN, that learnt  information is not used in forwarding decisions taken for the same  address relative to any other VLAN in the given set. This  operational mode indicates that all unicast, multicast and broadcast  traffic is scoped to a specific VLAN. A value of svl(2) indicates the device supports Shared VLAN Learning (SVL). Configuration and operation of the Learning Process and the Filtering Database such that, for a given set of VLANs, if a given individual MAC address is learnt in one VLAN, that learnt information is used in forwarding decisions taken for the same address relative to any other VLAN in the given set. In a bridge that supports SVL operation, the `given set of VLANS' is the set of all VLANS (1 - 4094). This operational mode allows all unicast  traffic to be bridged between VLANS, while scoping all unknown,  multicast and broadcast traffic to a specific VLAN. A value of svlivl(3) indicates the device supports both Shared and Independent VLAN learning simultaneously. This operational mode allows learnt information to be shared between those VLANS for which SVL is necessary while also allowing learnt information not to  be shared between those VLANS for which IVL is necessary.  All three of the aforementioned modes operate by placing VLANs in  `sets'. In IVL each VLAN is mapped to a separate set while in SVL  each VLAN is mapped to the same set. Accordingly, svlivl is a  combination of both. Each set is realized as a separate filter  database. Each filter database is uniquely identified by a Filter  Database Identifier (FID). The mapping of VLANs to filter databases  is defined in the ctVlanIdToFidMapping leaf of the ctVlanConfigTable.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.6.1.4.1.2,CTRON-VLAN-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctVlanClassifyDataMeaning,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,etherType(1):llcDsapSsap(2):ipTypeOfService(3):ipProtocolType(4):ipxClassOfService(5):ipxPacketType(6):ipAddressSource(7):ipAddressDestination(8):ipAddressBilateral(9):ipxNetworkSource(10):ipxNetworkDestination(11):ipxNetworkBilateral(12):ipUdpPortSource(13):ipUdpPortDestination(14):ipUdpPortBilateral(15):ipTcpPortSource(16):ipTcpPortDestination(17):ipTcpPortBilateral(18):ipxSocketSource(19):ipxSocketDestination(20):ipxSocketBilateral(21):macAddressSource(22):macAddressDestination(23):macAddressBilateral(24):ipFragments(25):ipUdpPortSourceRange(26):ipUdpPortDestinationRange(27):ipUdpPortBilateralRange(28):ipTcpPortSourceRange(29):ipTcpPortDestinationRange(30):ipTcpPortBilateralRange(31):icmpType(32):vlanId(33):tci(34),The meaning of the ctVlanClassifyDataVal leaf for this conceptual row. The ctVlanClassifyDataVal specifies a particular value which, when compared to packet data, is used to classify that packet into a particular VLAN. The part of the packet (if any), to which this data comparison applies, is determined by this object. For example, the value ipAddressBilateral(8) means that the value ctVlanClassifyDataVal for this entry is an IP address. It further means that the given IP address will be compared against both source and destination IP address fields in a packet. Such an entry obviously would not not match against any non-IP packets. Additionally, the value of this leaf will impose certain implicit ranges and interpretations of data contained within the ctVlanClassifyDataVal leaf for this entry. The specific limitations of each type should be spelled out in the comments for that type.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.6.1.4.1.3,CTRON-VLAN-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctVlanClassifyDataVal,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,The data value associated with ctVlanClassifyDataMeaning. The explicit range of this value is any unsigned 32-bit integer(0..4294967295). This range may vary, however,  depending upon the value of ctVlanClassifyDataMeaning. Illegal values should not be allowed.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.6.1.4.1.4,CTRON-VLAN-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctVlanClassifyDataMask,Unsigned32,not-accessible,,current,,This object is the one's complement of a 32-bit mask. This mask is applicable to the data comparison of ctVlanClassifyDataVal. The mask is applied to the actual packet data under consideration through a logical bitwise AND operation. This result is then compared to the data. For example, we want to classify according to a bilateral IP address of 134.141.0.0 with a mask of 255.255.240.0. This would be reflected by the following values: ctVlanClassifyDataMeaning: ipAddressBilateral(8) ctVlanClassifyDataVal: 0x868d0000 ctVlanClassifyDataMask: 0x00000fff Again there are contextual implications for this leaf depending upon the value of ctVlanClassifyDataMeaning. Not all types will use the mask, and others will impose restrictions. This value should however be a true indication of the masking operation. In other words, data types that don't use a mask should only allow a value of zero, indicating that all data bits are significant in the comparison. The specific restrictions of each type should be spelled out in the comments for that type. Illegal values should not be allowed.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.6.1.4.1.5,CTRON-VLAN-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctVlanClassifyIngressList,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The set of ports on which this classification rule applies. Classification occurs on ingress. An agent implementation should allow a set operation of this object to create a row if it does not exist.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.6.1.4.1.6,CTRON-VLAN-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctVlanClassifyRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This object provides both control and status for the associated conceptual row in the table. Rows can be created in two ways. createAndGo - The specified row will be created and activated if the instance is allowable. If not, an inconsistentValue exception will be returned and the row will not be created. This provides the most optimal method of creating an active row, but provides the user no explanation if the row cannot be created. createAndWait - The specified row will be created and put in the notInService state if the instance is allowable. A subsequent activation of this row will bring it into the active state. If the instance is not allowable, the row will be created and put in the notReady state. A subsequent activation of this row will fail. Since the inappropriate information is always contained in the indexing leaves, activation will never succeed and the row should be removed by the management station. When a row is in the notReady state, the ctVlanClassifyRowInfo may be retrieved to obtain a plain English explanation of why this row cannot be activated. createAndWait is the preferred method for this reason.  Both methods described above leave ctVlanClassifyIngressList in it's default state, requiring an additional set operation in order to modify it. An even more optimal twist on the createAndWait method is to set the ctVlanClassifyIngressList to it's desired value as a method for row creation. This will essentially cause an implicit createAndWait since it too will leave the row in either the notInService or notReady state. This leaves only activation or error analysis as the last step. Any rows left in the notReady or notInService state for more than 5 minutes should be automatically removed by the agent implementation.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.16.6.1.4.1.7,CTRON-VLAN-CLASSIFY-MIB::ctVlanClassifyRowInfo,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object provides info about this row in the form of an ASCII string, suitable for display purposes. The intended purpose of this object is to provide an 'agent-specific' explanation as to why the ctVlanClassifyRowStatus for this conceptual row is in the 'notReady' state. A management station should read this object and display it to the user in this case. A conceptual row that does not fall into this category may simply return a single NULL, but may also provide any useful info of its choice. A management station may attempt to display such info if it so chooses, but is under no burden to do so.

When this is forwardNoFrames(1), the device will not forward traffic out this port, for any VLAN that does not have an  entry in the dot1qVlanCurrentTable. When this is forwardAllFramesAsTagged(2), the device will  forward all traffic out this port, with an 802.1Q VLAN tag, for any VLAN that does not have an entry in  dot1qVlanCurrentTable. When this is forwardAllFramesAsUntagged(3), the device will  forward all traffic out this port, without an 802.1Q VLAN tag, for any VLAN that does not have an entry in  dot1qVlanCurrentTable. This control does not affect VLAN independent BPDU frames, such as GVRP and STP. It does affect VLAN dependent BPDU frames, such as GMRP.

When this is enabled(1), the device will discard all 802.1Q  tagged packets received on this port. When this is disabled(2), the device will NOT discard frames received on this port based on the presence of an 802.1Q tag. The behavior of this method in conjunction with the dot1qPortAcceptableFrameTypes leaf of Q-BRIDGE-MIB [RFC2674] is that of a logical OR.

When this is enabled(1), the device will replace the 802.1Q  TCI field with results of the INGRESS stage of frame forwarding. Logically, this happens immediately prior to the PROGRESS stage of frame relay. When this is disabled(2), the device operates in compliance with the IEEE 802.1Q standard and honors the TCI field of incident frames.

The  value enabled(1) indicates that Dynamic Egress is enabled on  this VLAN. If Dynamic Egress is enabled for a VLAN the  following rules are applied to received frames: 1. If the frame is untagged, and 2. The frame is successfully classified to the specified  VLAN, and 3. The port the frame was received on is not configured in dot1qVlanCurrentEgressPorts, dot1qVlanCurrentUntaggedPorts, or dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts, for the classified VLAN, and 4. The port is configured for forwardNoFrames(1) in ctDot1qPortDefaultForwardMode (if supported), then 5. The port the frame was received on will be added to the dot1qVlanCurrentEgressPorts and  dot1qVlanCurrentUntaggedPorts for the classified VLAN.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.20.1.1.3,CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB::ctTrunkConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table describing all of the trunk interfaces implemented by this host. Each trunk has a row in the MIB-II/RFC 2233 Interfaces table (describing the structure of the trunk interface it presents to higher layers). Each trunk interface also has a row in this and other CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB tables. Smart Trunks use ifType propMultiplexor(54). Counters represent the aggregate of all physcal links. Unlike hardware ports, trunk interfaces can be created by management. However, the RFC 2233 Interfaces table does not directly support row creation. Therefore, creating or deleting a row in the ctTrunkConfigTable is defined to have the side effect of creating or deleting corresponding rows in - the MIB-II / RFC 2233 Interfaces table, - any other dependent tables New Interfaces table rows for trunk intefaces always have 'ifAdminStatus' set to 'down' until the row state is becomes Active. Then administration of the interface uses normal ifTable ifAdminStatus to enabled it.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.20.1.1.3.1,CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB::ctTrunkConfigEntry,,not-accessible,ctTrunkIndex,current,,Each table entry contains configuration information for one trunk interface.

The Table allows sparse values. If the conceptual row identified by this value of ctTrunkIndex is recreated following an agent restart, the same value of ctTrunkIndex must be used to identify the recreated row. (However, the Interfaces table index associated with the client may change. ifAlias in ifXTable is used then to reassociate ifIndexes based on ifAlias. In the case of the SSR, Smart Trunks are manipulated as st.ctTrunkIndex
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.20.1.1.3.1.2,CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB::ctTrunkConfigName,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The Trunk's Name, just for informational purposes. It may be changed regardless of the RowStatus value.

It does not control the activation and deactivation of these interfaces; they are controlled by 'ifAdminStatus' in the ifTable. However, changing row state from active to notInService. will have the side effect of changing their 'ifAdminStatus' values to 'noPresent' or 'down', thus causing any active trunk connections to be terminated. When creating a trunk interface, it is up to the management station to determine a suitable 'ctTrunkIndex'. To facilitate interoperability, agents should not put any restrictions on the 'ctTrunkIndex' beyond the obvious ones that it be valid and unused. The Managed Objects that must be set in this table for a row to change from nonExistent/notReady to notInService/Active is simply an index. Ports can then be added to the Smart TRUNK via the ifStackTable. If you create a trunk interface via this object, it will initially have 'ifAdminStatus' = 'down' 'ifOperStatus' = 'down' when RowStatus is changed to active.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.20.1.1.4,CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB::ctTrunkConnectionTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table describes how local interfaces that are participating in a trunk are connected to remote interfaces. With this table, a management entity can determine that (for example) local interfaces 3, 4, and 6 are connected to remote interfaces 10, 17, and 19. This table is useful to debug configuration errors with remote devices. If ifAdminStatus/ifOperState is up, and no corresponding row is found in this table, then a management station can assume a the remote end does not have the decHuntGroup protocol active. Note: this entire table is read-only. Rows are created and deleted from this table as a side effect of trunks being created and deleted. Note: a managment entity could determine (for example) that interface 3 was participating in trunk 3 by using the ifStackTable and ctTrunkIfIndex.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.20.1.1.4.1,CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB::ctTrunkConnectionEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,Each table entry contains configuration information for one interface that is participating in a trunk.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.2.20.1.1.4.1.1,CTRON-SMARTTRUNK-MIB::ctTrunkPortRemoteIfIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The ifIndex of the interface at the other end of this part of the trunk link. If this value is 0, then for some reason there is no interface on the other side of this link. This might be a temporary condition or it might represent a real problem. Note: this table is indexed by ifIndex. So the index is the local ifIndex value and ctTrunkPortRemoteIfIndex is the remote ifIndex.

Certain families of products require LLAP (decHuntGroup Protocol) order for the Smart TRUNK functionality to work. A value of 1 implies that LLAP is necessary for smart-trunking to work on this platform, a value of 2 indicates that it is not necessary.

Similarly if ids 1 and 5 were set to  'routing protocol' then IGMP would treat received frames with these ids as routing protocols, etc.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::cabletronAliasMib,,,,,,This MIB module defines a portion of the MIB tree under the Enterasys enterprise OID. This branch  defines Enterasys Networks' proprietary Node Alias feature. This MIB defines objects which can be used to discover  end systems per port, and to map end system addresses to the layer 2 address of the port.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.1,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The ctAliasTable contains information about the aliases known by the agent. This table is indexed using a unique and arbitrary ID and a TimeFilter to allow a management station to learn all alias entries that have been modified since time X. This table is NOT designed to do a single GET. This Table is designed for MIB Walks only. This table contains objects that map upper-layer  network services and entities to the physical location  of the associated port, and the MAC address of the associated end-system (node). All entries in this table are deleted when sysUpTime is reset to zero. This table allows for a time filtered view. It is useful  for determining what has been modified in the Alias Table  since a specified time. If a management station reads the ctAliasTable of an entity at time X, subsequent updates can be  realized by performing get-next requests of this table to determine which entries have been modified  since time X. Then the management station can use GET requests to retrieve only the records of interest from the Alias table.  There is a delay between retrieving the Alias Reference  values from this table, and a GET request to retrieve a  modified row from the Alias table. The management  station should be prepared for two possibilities: 1) the GET request may fail if the Alias table entry  has been deleted during the delay, and 2) the  entry may have been modified during the delay, so the modification time of the retrieved entry may differ from  the modification time of the Delta entry. If the entry in the Alias Control table identified by  ctAliasID is marked inactive by management request, and  subsequently deleted to free resources, all corresponding  entries in this table are also deleted. If the agent needs to free resources, it can delete entries from this table. It SHOULD first remove those which have been marked inactive in the ctAliasControlTable,  then it SHOULD remove those entries with the oldest  modification times.

The ifIndex is an 'external value' that identifies a  physical component associated with the Alias entry. This object can be used to identify the physical location of the interface in the ifTable [RFC2863].  The possibility of ifIndex value re-assignment must be accommodated by a management application whenever the  value of sysUpTime is reset to zero. Since ifIndex values in different 'naming scopes' are  not related to one another, the interface to physical  component associations are relative to the same logical entity within the agent. For more discussion  of naming scopes, see the ENTITY-MIB [RFC2037]

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.2,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table allows for control of Alias entries. Currently control is limited to marking entries as marked for deletion. If the entry in the Alias Control table identified by  ctAliasID is marked inactive by management request, and  subsequently deleted to free resources, all corresponding  entries in the ctAlias table are also deleted. All entries in this table are deleted when sysUpTime is reset to zero.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.2.1,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasControlEntry,,not-accessible,ctAliasID,current,,Each entry contains a unique identifier of an Alias  entry and a control object to mark the entry as  'marked for deletion'.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.2.1.2,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasMarkInactive,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,true(1):false(2),This object provides the control to mark this entry to inactive.  When an entry is created by the agent, this is set to false(2). A network management application can set this value to true(1), indicating that the entry is no longer needed. Once this object has been set to true(1), it cannot be set to false(2).  If the alias is detected again by the agent, the agent may create a new entry for the Alias. When an agent needs to free up resources, it may choose to delete those entries marked inactive.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.2.1.3,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasEntryStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,active(1):inactive(2):remove(3),This object provides the control to remove or inactivate entries that are no longer needed. active(1) - indicates that this entry is active. inactive(2) - indicates that this entry is no longer of any interest and can be removed, as needed, by the entity. If the alias is marked inactive and is seen again by the agent, the alias ID's status will be changed to active. remove(3) - indicates that the agent SHOULD immediately remove the entry from the table. If the alias is seen again by the agent after having been  removed, it will be added as a new aliasID.

When the object ctAliasConfigurationInterfaceTotalEntries equals this object, the next alias appearing  on this ctAliasInterface causes the oldest entry  created by this ctAliasInterface to be deleted.  The sum of this object across all ctAliasInterface  shall not exceed ctAliasConfigurationSystemTotalEntries.  If the value of this object is increased, then oldest  entry removal ceases until the maximum is reached  again. If management reduces the value of this  object, then, starting with the oldest, alias  entries are removed until the new number of  entries is reached.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.4.3.1.3,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasConfigurationInterfaceEnableState,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),The enable state of the alias agent on this ctAliasInterface.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.4.3.1.4,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasConfigurationNumQueueWraps,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object represents the number of times the queue for this ctAliasConfigurationEntry has wrapped. Since circular queues are used for storing the entries, when all allocated entries are used, the oldest entries are reused, thus creating a wrap condition. A value of zero indicates the queue has not wrapped, except in the case that the counter itself has wrapped.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.5,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasMacAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The ctAliasMacAddressTable contains information about the aliases known by the agent indexed by MAC address and protocol. This table contains information that is identical to the ctAliasTable, but it is instanced by MAC address and protocol to allow management entities to search for a MAC address and protocol, or part of a MAC address and protocol, using a single SNMP GetNext request.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.3.7.1.1.5.1,CTRON-ALIAS-MIB::ctAliasMacAddressEntry,,not-accessible,ctAliasMacAddress:ctAliasProtocol:ctAliasAddress:ctAliasReference,current,,Each entry contains information pertaining to the alias of a node in a table indexed by MAC address, protocol type, protocol address, and alias ID.

The ifIndex is an 'external value' that identifies a  physical component associated with the Alias entry. This object can be used to identify the physical location of the interface in the ifTable [RFC2863].  The possibility of ifIndex value re-assignment must be accommodated by a management application whenever the  value of sysUpTime is reset to zero. Since ifIndex values in different 'naming scopes' are  not related to one another, the interface to physical  component associations are relative to the same logical entity within the agent. For more discussion  of naming scopes, see the ENTITY-MIB [RFC2037]

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.1.5.12.1.2.1.3,CTRON-TX-QUEUE-ARBITRATION-MIB::ctTxQArbNumSlices,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of 'slices' into which transmit resources are divided. This determines the resolution with which transmit priority can be allocated to each of the transmit queues. For example, if the number of slices is 16, then transmit resources may be allocated to each transmit queue in units of 1/16 (6.25% of the total). The numbers of slices allocated to all queues must add up to the value of this object (i.e., 100%).

This allows for fine-tuning of the 'strict priority' configuration. Under strict priority, the highest queue (ctTxQArbNumQueues - 1) has the highest priority, followed by (ctTxQArbNumQueues - 2), etc. Queue 0 always has the lowest priority. All entries in a higher priority queue will be transmitted before any entries from the lower priority queues. This object allows the modification of the strict  priority scheme so that lower priority queues can be guaranteed some access to the transmitter. This object is an octet string in which the number of octets corresponds to the number of transmit queues for each port in this port group, as indicated by ctTxQArbNumQueues. The value of the first octet  represents the number of 'slices' of transmit resources to allocate to  Queue 0, the second octet represents the number for Queue 1, and so forth. The sum of all the octets in the octet string must add up to  the total number of slices available for the port. For example, on a port having 4 transmit queues and where transmit  resources are divided into 16 slices, writing an octet string of  {0x00, 0x04, 0x04, 0x08} would have the following effect: At least 50% of the frames transmitted are from Queue 3 At least 25% of the frames transmitted are from Queue 2 At least 25% of the frames transmitted are from Queue 1 No frames will be transmitted from Queue 0 until Queues 1, 2 and 3 are empty.

That is, it effectively dissasociates the circuit identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant nwIpHostMapType object.

Entries in this table represent explicit permissions. The host(s) represented by a range entry may exchange packets with this router if it (they) match the port specified in the entry. Optionally physical address may be locked as well. This table functions in concert with the workgroup security level as defined in the IP Work Group Definition Table entry.

If the range consists of a single host address the entry may optionally specify a physical address. The entry is indexed by the range and the port. Ranges may not overlap. However a range may be duplicated on different ports. The address range must lie within the subnet defined for a given workgroup and thus the entry acquires the security level of that workgroup. If security is violated, packets to and from a given host IP address will be filtered out passing through the router. The source and destination IP packet addresses are checked against ranges in the range table during packet forwarding and must match as follows: For a high (4) security workgroup, a host must match a single host range entry - it must reside on the port with the physical address as configured in that entry. For a medium (3) security workgroup, a host must match a range entry in that it resides on that port, but unless a physical address is also specified in that entry, the physical address is not constrained. For a low (2) security workgroup, a host is free to reside on any port with any physical address as long as its IP address does not lie within the range of any entry in the range table, but if it does fall in a range then it must completely match that entry, or another entry with the duplicate range. Match completely means match the port and, if a physical address is specified, match that as well.

The host may be `unknown' if ARP has not discovered on which port it resides. The status of `invalid-multiple' means the same host IP address was later found duplicated on another port. The status of `invalid-physaddr' means the host matched an entry in the IP Work Group Range Table with respect to range and port, but did not match that entry for physical address. If the workgroup was high security this status would result even if no physical address was given in the range entry. The status of `invalid-range' could either mean that, in a high or medium security workgroup, the host was not in the range of any entry in the IP WORK GROUP Range Table, or that it was not in the range of an entry with a matching port. The status of `invalid-interface' could mean the port was physically down or just not in service in the IP Work Group Interface Table. The status of `invalid-workgroup' could mean the workgroup does not exist or is not in service in the IP Work Group Definition Table. The status of `invalid-expired' means the host became inactive and aged out on the port on which it was learned.

The WouldBeBlocked value is used to represent a node that would be in the blocked state if the SourceBlocker was enabled. A node can get into this state only if the blocker is disabled. If the blocker is enabled at this point, the node will be blocked, and a connection filter will be put in place when the next packet is received from this node

When a node is unblockable, it will never be blocked regardless of the number of packets it sends. The default setting is blockable. Any node can be changed to unblockable via the Source Blocker API (SBAPI).
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.2.4.2.2.14.5.1.1.9,CTRON-SFPS-BASE-MIB::sfpsBlockSourceExcludeFilterPresent,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,, Flags whether or not a connection filter is in place for the given node. (This attribute cannot be changed on its own and is therefore used only for diagnostic purposes. It is used internally so that only one filter connection will be mapped per node.)

If the 'blocked' flag is set, this value represents the index into the BlockSourceOnly table. If the 'unblockable' flag is set, this value represents the index into the UnblockableOnly table. Otherwise, this value is set to -1 (representing that it is not used

An attempt to reconnect is made after the delay specified in MC_CONFIG_API_REMAP_DELAY.  Only the number of MC_CONFIG_API_PENDING_MAPS will be  deferred. If you lose 100 connections and this number is set to 20, at best you'll reconnect 20 streams after the delay.

It is used to determine if a sender is still  sending. After one age out interval, the sender is placed in a dying state and the local switch starts to listen for traffic from that sender on a specific destination. If any traffic is received, the sender if placed back in a non-dying state. If no traffic is seen before the second age interval, the sender is considered dead and the corresponding connection tree for that da/sa connection is removed throughout the domain.

All sender refreshes will occur within 12 seconds. If this number is set to 60, 1/2 of the senders will be announced every 60 seconds. If this number is 30, 1/4 of the senders will be announced every 30 seconds. If the number of senders grows, the refresh interval may have to be adjusted shorter. The fine tuning is to determine which is better, fewer-bigger announcements, or more-smaller announcements. Value will not take effect until blade is reset.

Mode 1 - Do no vlan checking. The sender and  receivers do not have to be on the same vlan. Multicast connections in this mode disregard whether or not the sender or receiver is in a secure or open vlan. Mode 2 - Do some vlan checking. This mode allows connections to be established between any sender/receivers on any vlan except for groups using the 224.0.0.x range of ip multicast addresses. These addresses are used for the most part by routers which should only be communicating to each other when they are in the same vlan. Mode 2 restricts routers to have the same port based vlan membership. Mode 3 - Check all. The sender and receivers have to be members of the same port based vlan. This setting takes effect immediately. No existing connections will be torn down.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.2.31.1.1.1.1.2,CTRON-ENTITY-STATE-MIB::ctEntStateAdmin,INTEGER,read-write,,current,unknown(1):locked(2):shuttingDown(3):unlocked(4),The administrative state for this entity. This object refers to an entities administrative permission to service both other entities within its containment hierarchy as well other users of its services defined by means outside the scope of this MIB. Setting this object to 'notSupported' will result in an 'inconsistentValue' error. For entities that do not support administrative state, all set operations will result in an 'inconsistentValue' error. Some physical entities exhibit only a subset of the remaining administrative state values. Some entities cannot be locked, and hence this object exhibits only the 'unlocked' state. Other entities can not be shutdown gracefully, and hence this object does not exhibit the 'shuttingDown' state. A value of 'inconsistentValue' will be returned if attempts are made to set this object to values not supported by its administrative model.

Note that unlike the state model used within the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863], this object does not follow the administrative state. An administrative state of down does not predict an operational state of disabled. A value of 'testing' means that entity currently being tested and cannot there fore report whether it is operational or not. A value of 'disabled' means that an entity is totally inoperable and unable to provide service both to entities within its containment hierarchy, or to other receivers of its service as defined in ways outside the scope of this MIB. A value of 'enabled' means that an entity is fully or partially operable and able to provide service both to entities within its containment hierarchy, or to other receivers of its service as defined in ways outside the scope of this MIB. Note that some implementations may not be able to accurately report ctEntStateOper while the ctEntStateAdmin object has a value other than 'unlocked'. In these cases, this object MUST have a value of 'unknown'.

This object refers to an entity's ability to service more physical entities in a containment hierarchy. A value of 'idle' means this entity is able to contain other entities but that no other entity is currently contained within this entity. A value of 'active' means that at least one entity is contained within this entity, but that it could handle more. A value of 'busy' means that the entity is unable to handle any additional entities being contained in it. Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the usage state values. Entities that are unable to ever service any entities within a containment hierarchy will always have a usage state of 'busy'. Some entities will only ever be able to support one entity within its containment hierarchy and will therefore only exhibit values of 'idle' and 'busy'.

It does not include the alarms raised on child components within its containment hierarchy. A value of 'unknown' means that this entity is unable to report alarm state. Note that this differs from 'indeterminate' which means that that alarm state is supported and there are alarms against this entity, but the severity of some of the alarms is not known If no bits are set, then this entity supports reporting of alarms, but there are currently no active alarms against this entity. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.52.4.2.31.1.1.1.1.6,CTRON-ENTITY-STATE-MIB::ctEntStateStandby,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(1):hotStandby(2):coldStandby(3):providingService(4),The standby status for this entity. Some entities will exhibit only a subset of the remaining standby state values. If this entity cannot operate in a standby role, the value of this object will always be 'providingService'.

This object isused to manage the creation and deletion of conceptual rows.  The status column has six defined values:  - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is available for use by the managed device;  - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by the managed device (see NOTE below);  - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is missing information necessary in order to be available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row and to have its status automatically set to active, making it available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row (but not make it available for use by the managed device); and, - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station wishing to delete all of the instances associated with an existing conceptual row.  Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may be specified in a management protocol set operation, only three values will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation: `notReady', `notInService' or `active'. That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row has only three states: it is either available for use by the managed device (the status column has value `active'); it is not available for use by the managed device, though the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient information (the state column has value `notReady').

This object isused to manage the creation and deletion of conceptual rows.  The status column has six defined values:  - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is available for use by the managed device;  - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by the managed device (see NOTE below);  - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is missing information necessary in order to be available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row and to have its status automatically set to active, making it available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row (but not make it available for use by the managed device); and,  - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station wishing to delete all of the instances associated with an existing conceptual row.  Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may be specified in a management protocol set operation, only three values will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation: `notReady', `notInService' or `active'. That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row has only three states: it is either available for use by the managed device (the status column has value `active'); it is not available for use by the managed device, though the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient information (the state column has value `notReady').

This object isused to manage the creation and deletion of conceptual rows.  The status column has six defined values:  - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is available for use by the managed device;  - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by the managed device (see NOTE below);  - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is missing information necessary in order to be available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row and to have its status automatically set to active, making it available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row (but not make it available for use by the managed device); and,  - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station wishing to delete all of the instances associated with an existing conceptual row.  Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may be specified in a management protocol set operation, only three values will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation: `notReady', `notInService' or `active'. That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row has only three states: it is either available for use by the managed device (the status column has value `active'); it is not available for use by the managed device, though the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient information (the state column has value `notReady').

The status column has six defined values:  - `active', which indicates that the conceptual row is available for use by the managed device;  - `notInService', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is unavailable for use by the managed device (see NOTE below);  - `notReady', which indicates that the conceptual row exists in the agent, but is missing information necessary in order to be available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndGo', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row and to have its status automatically set to active, making it available for use by the managed device;  - `createAndWait', which is supplied by a management station wishing to create a new instance of a conceptual row (but not make it available for use by the managed device); and,  - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station wishing to delete all of the instances associated with an existing conceptual row.  Whereas five of the six values (all except `notReady') may be specified in a management protocol set operation, only three values will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation: `notReady', `notInService' or `active'. That is, when queried, an existing conceptual row has only three states: it is either available for use by the managed device (the status column has value `active'); it is not available for use by the managed device, though the agent has sufficient information to make it so (the status column has value `notInService'); or, it is not available for use by the managed device, and an attempt to make it so would fail because the agent has insufficient information (the state column has value `notReady').

There are four  priority levels: low, medium, high and control.  The highest priority class is reserved for router control traffic,  which leaves three classes, high, medium, and low for normal data flows. Buffered traffic in higher priority classes is sent ahead  of pending traffic in lower priority classes, which allows latency  and throughput demands to be maintained for the higher priority traffic.  To prevent low priority traffic from waiting indefinitely as higher  priority traffic fills the wire, a weighted fair queuing mechanism provides  adjustable minimum bandwidth guarantees at each output port, thereby ensuring  that some traffic from each priority class always gets through.

For a management protocol set operation, a genErr response is returned when the row already exists. - `destroy', which is supplied by a management station wishing to delete all of the instances associated with an existing conceptual row. Note that all of the above values may be specified in a management protocol set operation, and only the 'active' value will be returned in response to a management protocol retrieval operation. For a management protocol set operation, if other variable bindings are included in the same PDU, then a genErr response is returned.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leClientMIB,,,,,,This module defines a portion of the management  information base (MIB) for managing ATM LAN Emulation Client nodes. It is meant to be used in connection with the AToM MIB and MIB-II / RFC 1573 'ifTable' entries for each LEC / emulated 802.x network interface.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leClientMIBObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table describing all of the LAN Emulation Clients implemented by this host. Each LE Client has a row in the MIB-II/RFC 1573 Interfaces table (describing the emulated packet interface it presents to higher layers). Each LE Client also has a row in this and other LEC MIB tables (describing its interface with other LAN Emulation components). This table contains configuration variables. Three extension tables contain client status, performance statistics, and information about control/multicast VCCs. Unlike hardware ports, LE Clients can be created by management. However, the RFC 1573 Interfaces table does not directly support row creation. Therefore, creating or deleting a row in the lecConfigTable is defined to have the side effect of creating or deleting corresponding rows in - the MIB-II / RFC 1573 Interfaces table, - the 'lecMappingTable', - the 'lecStatusTable', - the 'lecServerVccTable', - the 'lecStatisticsTable', and - any other dependent tables New Interfaces table rows for LAN Emulation Clients always have 'ifAdminStatus' set to 'down'. A Note On Indexing: ------------------- Most of the tables in this MIB are indexed in whole or in part by 'lecIndex' - not by 'ifIndex'. Why is there a separate index? Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents, and are permitted to change across restarts. Using ifIndex to index lecConfigTable could complicate row creation and/or cause interoperability problems (if each agent had special restrictions on ifIndex). Having a separate index avoids these problems. 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.1.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecConfigEntry,,not-accessible,lecIndex,current,,Each table entry contains configuration information for one LAN Emulation Client. Most of the objects are derived from Initial State Parameters in the LAN Emulation specification.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.1.1.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecIndex,INTEGER,not-accessible,,current,,A value which uniquely identifies this conceptual row in the lecConfigTable. If the conceptual row identified by this value of lecIndex is recreated following an agent restart, the same value of lecIndex must be used to identify the recreated row. (However, the Interfaces table index associated with the client may change.)
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.1.1.2,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This object lets network managers create and delete LAN Emulation Clients, on systems that support this optional capability. It does not control Joins and Terminations; they are controlled by 'ifAdminStatus'. However, taking rows out of service will have the side effect of changing their 'ifAdminStatus' values to 'down', thus causing any active emulated LAN connections to be terminated. Within each conceptual lecConfigTable row, objects which are writable may be modified regardless of the value of lecRowStatus. It is not necessary to set a row's status to 'notInService' first. When creating a LAN Emulation Client, it is up to the management station to determine a suitable 'lecIndex'. To facilitate interoperability, agents should not put any restrictions on the 'lecIndex' beyond the obvious ones that it be valid and unused. If you create a LAN Emulation Client via this object, it will initially have 'ifAdminStatus' = 'down' 'ifOperStatus' = 'down' 'lecInterfaceState' = 'initialState' 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.1.1.3,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.1.1.4,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecConfigMode,INTEGER,read-create,,current,automatic(1):manual(2),Indicates whether this LAN Emulation Client should auto-configure the next time it is (re)started. In automatic(1) mode, a client uses a LAN Emulation Configuration Server to learn the ATM address of its LAN Emulation Server, and to obtain other parameters. lecConfig{ LanType, MaxDataFrameSize, LanName } are used in the Configure request. lecConfigLesAtmAddress is ignored. In manual(2) mode, management tells the client the ATM address of its LAN Emulation Server and the values of other parameters. lecConfig{ LanType, MaxDataFrameSize, LanName } are used in the Join request. lecConfigLesAtmAddress tells the client which LES to call.

C8 Route Descriptor(s). Route Descriptors exist only for source-routed IEEE 802.5 LE Clients that are Source-Route Bridges. All Route Descriptors in any given emulated LAN MUST be unique. A LE Client MAY have zero or more Route Descriptors and these Route Descriptors MAY change during normal operation. In an operational LE Client, every Local Route Descriptor in C8 MUST have been registered with the LE Server. When answering a LE_ARP_REQUEST for any address in this list, the 'Remote Address' bit in the FLAGS field of the LE_ARP_RESPONSE MUST be clear.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.8.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::lecRouteDescrEntry,,not-accessible,lecIndex:lecRouteDescrSegmentID:lecRouteDescrBridgeNumber,current,,Each table row describes a (Route Descriptor, ATM address) pair registered for a particular client.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.9,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leArpTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table provides access to an ATM LAN Emulation Client's MAC-to-ATM ARP cache. It contains entries for unicast addresses and for the broadcast address, but not for multicast MAC addresses. C16 LE_ARP Cache. A table of entries, each of which establishes a relationship between a LAN Destination external to the LE Client and the ATM address to which data frames for that LAN Destination will be sent.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.9.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leArpEntry,,not-accessible,lecIndex:leArpMacAddress,current,,An ATM LAN Emulation ARP cache entry containing information about the binding of one MAC address to one ATM address.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.9.1.1,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leArpMacAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The MAC address for which this cache entry provides a translation. Since ATM LAN Emulation uses an ARP protocol to locate the Broadcast and Unknown Server, the value of this object could be the broadcast MAC address. MAC addresses should be unique within any given ATM Emulated LAN. However, there's no requirement that they be unique across disjoint emulated LANs.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.9.1.2,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leArpAtmAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The ATM address of the Broadcast & Unknown Server or LAN Emulation Client whose MAC address is stored in 'leArpMacAddress'. This value may be determined through the use of the LE_ARP procedure, through source address learning, or through other mechanisms. Some agents may provide write access to this object, as part of their support for 'static' LE_ARP entries. The effect of attempting to write an ATM address to a 'learned' row is explicitly undefined. Agents may disallow the write, accept the write and change the row's type, or even accept the write as-is.
.1.3.6.1.4.1.353.5.3.1.1.9.1.3,LAN-EMULATION-CLIENT-MIB::leArpIsRemoteAddress,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),Indicates whether this entry is for a local or remote MAC address. In this context, 'local' means 'a MAC address that is local to the remote client', as opposed to 'one of my addresses'. true(1) The address is believed to be remote - or its local/remote status is unknown. For an entry created via the LE_ARP mechanism, this corresponds to the 'Remote address' flag being set in the LE_ARP_RESPONSE. During Topology Change periods, remote LE_ARP entries generally age out faster than others. Specifically, they are subject to the Forward Delay Time as well as to the Aging Time. false(2) The address is believed to be local - that is to say, registered with the LES by the client whose ATM address is leArpAtmAddress. For an entry created via the LE_ARP mechanism, this corresponds to the 'Remote address' flag being cleared in the LE_ARP_RESPONSE.

Normally clients will maintain their LE_ARP caches automatically. However, managers may occasionally want to create 'static' LE_ARP cache entries. Rules 1. Before a new row can become 'active', values must be supplied for the columnar objects leArpAtmAddress and leArpEntryType. 2. It is not necessary to set leArpRowStatus to 'notInService' in order to modify a writable object in the same conceptual row. 3. LE_ARP entries whose status is 'notReady' or 'notInService' will not be used to translate LAN Destinations to ATM Addresses. However, clients may overwrite such entries with data obtained from other sources. For example, a client which needed to transmit a data frame to a given MAC address (or via a given Route Descriptor) might find that its LE_ARP entry for the LAN Destination is 'notInService' or 'notReady'. The client might then act as if the LAN Destination was unknown - generating a LE_ARP_REQUEST, flooding the data frame to the BUS, and creating a new, 'active' LE_ARP cache entry based on the LE_ARP_RESPONSE.
