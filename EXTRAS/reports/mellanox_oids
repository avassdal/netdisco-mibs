.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1,SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the entity. This value should include the full name and version identification of the system's hardware type, software operating-system, and networking software.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2,SNMPv2-MIB::sysObjectID,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The vendor's authoritative identification of the network management subsystem contained in the entity. This value is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed. For example, if vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242, it could assign the identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.424242.1.1 to its `Fred Router'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3,SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The time (in hundredths of a second) since the network management portion of the system was last re-initialized.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5,SNMPv2-MIB::sysName,OCTET,read-write,,current,,An administratively-assigned name for this managed node. By convention, this is the node's fully-qualified domain name. If the name is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6,SNMPv2-MIB::sysLocation,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The physical location of this node (e.g., 'telephone closet, 3rd floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7,SNMPv2-MIB::sysServices,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the set of services that this entity may potentially offer. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each layer, L, in the range 1 through 7, that this node performs transactions for, 2 raised to (L - 1) is added to the sum. For example, a node which performs only routing functions would have a value of 4 (2^(3-1)). In contrast, a node which is a host offering application services would have a value of 72 (2^(4-1) + 2^(7-1)). Note that in the context of the Internet suite of protocols, values should be calculated accordingly: layer functionality 1 physical (e.g., repeaters) 2 datalink/subnetwork (e.g., bridges) 3 internet (e.g., supports the IP) 4 end-to-end (e.g., supports the TCP) 7 applications (e.g., supports the SMTP) For systems including OSI protocols, layers 5 and 6 may also be counted.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.4,IF-MIB::ifMtu,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5,IF-MIB::ifSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).

The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.

One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType.

Also, implementations which authenticate community-based SNMP messages using check(s) in addition to matching the community name (for example, by also checking whether the message originated from a transport address allowed to use a specified community name) MAY include in this value the number of messages which failed the additional check(s). It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the documentation for any security model which is used to authenticate community-based SNMP messages specify the precise conditions that contribute to this value.

Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1,IF-MIB::ifName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the interface. The value of this object should be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's `console'. This might be a text name, such as `le0' or a simple port number, such as `1', depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each will have the same value of ifName. Note that for an agent which responds to SNMP queries concerning an interface on some other (proxied) device, then the value of ifName for such an interface is the proxied device's local name for it. If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string.

If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart. DEFVAL { volatile }

If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entPhysicalChildIndex,current,,A single container/'containee' relationship.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalChildIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the contained physical entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time a conceptual row is created, modified, or deleted in any of these tables: - entPhysicalTable - entLogicalTable - entLPMappingTable - entAliasMappingTable - entPhysicalContainsTable 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTraps,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.
