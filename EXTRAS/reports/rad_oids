.1.0.8802.1.1.2.0.0.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTablesChange,,,,,,A lldpRemTablesChange notification is sent when the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger LLDP remote systems table maintenance polls. Note that transmission of lldpRemTablesChange notifications are throttled by the agent, as specified by the 'lldpNotificationInterval' object.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfiguration,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The interval at which LLDP frames are transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent. The default value for lldpMessageTxInterval object is 30 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 30 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The time-to-live value expressed as a multiple of the lldpMessageTxInterval object. The actual time-to-live value used in LLDP frames, transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent, can be expressed by the following formula: TTL = min(65535, (lldpMessageTxInterval * lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier)) For example, if the value of lldpMessageTxInterval is '30', and the value of lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier is '4', then the value '120' is encoded in the TTL field in the LLDP header. The default value for lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier object is 4. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 4 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpReinitDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpReinitDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) from when lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object of a particular port becomes 'disabled' until re-initialization will be attempted. The default value for lldpReintDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpTxDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpTxDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) between successive LLDP frame transmissions  initiated by value/status changes in the LLDP local systems MIB. The recommended value for the lldpTxDelay is set by the following formula: 1 <= lldpTxDelay <= (0.25 * lldpMessageTxInterval) The default value for lldpTxDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.5,LLDP-MIB::lldpNotificationInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object controls the transmission of LLDP notifications. the agent must not generate more than one lldpRemTablesChange notification-event in the indicated period, where a 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional changes in lldpRemoteSystemsData object groups occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should periodically check the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime to detect any missed lldpRemTablesChange notification-events, e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss. If notification transmission is enabled for particular ports, the suggested default throttling period is 5 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 5 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls LLDP frame transmission on individual ports.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigEntry,,not-accessible,lldpPortConfigPortNum,current,,LLDP configuration information for a particular port. This configuration parameter controls the transmission and the reception of LLDP frames on those ports whose rows are created in this table.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpPortConfigTable.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,txOnly(1):rxOnly(2):txAndRx(3):disabled(4),The administratively desired status of the local LLDP agent. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txOnly(1)', then LLDP agent will transmit LLDP frames on this port and it will not store any information about the remote systems connected.  If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'rxOnly(2)', then the LLDP agent will receive, but it will not transmit LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txAndRx(3)', then the LLDP agent will transmit and receive LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'disabled(4)', then LLDP agent will not transmit or receive LLDP frames on this port. If there is remote systems information which is received on this port and stored in other tables, before the port's lldpPortConfigAdminStatus becomes disabled, then the information will naturally age out. DEFVAL { txAndRx }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),The lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable controls, on a per port basis, whether or not notifications from the agent are enabled. The value true(1) means that notifications are enabled; the value false(2) means that they are not. DEFVAL { false }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable,BITS,read-write,,current,portDesc(0):sysName(1):sysDesc(2):sysCap(3),The lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable, defined as a bitmap, includes the basic set of LLDP TLVs whose transmission is allowed on the local LLDP agent by the network management. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a TLV type associated with a specific optional TLV. It should be noted that the organizationally-specific TLVs are excluded from the lldpTLVsTxEnable bitmap.  LLDP Organization Specific Information Extension MIBs should have similar configuration object to control transmission of their organizationally defined TLVs. The bit 'portDesc(0)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'Port Description TLV'. The bit 'sysName(1)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Name TLV'. The bit 'sysDesc(2)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Description TLV'. The bit 'sysCap(3)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Capabilities TLV'. There is no bit reserved for the management address TLV type since transmission of management address TLVs are controlled by another object, lldpConfigManAddrTable. The default value for lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable object is empty set, which means no enumerated values are set. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { { } }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls selection of LLDP management address TLV instances to be transmitted on individual ports.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,LLDP configuration information that specifies the set of ports (represented as a PortList) on which the local system management address instance will be transmitted. This configuration object augments the lldpLocManAddrEntry, therefore it is only present along with the management address instance contained in the associated lldpLocManAddrEntry entry. Each active lldpConfigManAddrEntry must be restored from non-volatile and re-created (along with the corresponding lldpLocManAddrEntry) after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable,OCTET,read-write,,current,,A set of ports that are identified by a PortList, in which each port is represented as a bit. The corresponding local system management address instance will be transmitted on the member ports of the lldpManAddrPortsTxEnable.  The default value for lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable object is empty binary string, which means no ports are specified for advertising indicated management address instance. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatistics,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime object (defined in IETF RFC 3418) at the time an entry is created, modified, or deleted in the in tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems. An NMS can use this object to reduce polling of the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesInserts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been inserted into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. The complete set of information received from a particular MSAP should be inserted into related tables. If partial information cannot be inserted for a reason such as lack of resources, all of the complete set of information should be removed. This counter should be incremented only once after the complete set of information is successfully recorded in all related tables. Any failures during inserting information set which result in deletion of previously inserted information should not trigger any changes in lldpStatsRemTablesInserts since the insert is not completed yet or or in lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes, since the deletion would only be a partial deletion. If the failure was the result of lack of resources, the lldpStatsRemTablesDrops counter should be incremented once.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely deleted from all related tables. Partial deletions, such as deletion of rows associated with a particular MSAP from some tables, but not from all tables are not allowed, thus should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDrops,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP could not be entered into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because of insufficient resources.

This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely invalidated (aged out) from all related tables. Partial aging, similar to deletion case, is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table containing LLDP transmission statistics for individual ports. Entries are not required to exist in this table while the lldpPortConfigEntry object is equal to 'disabled(4)'.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortEntry,,not-accessible,lldpStatsTxPortNum,current,,LLDP frame transmission statistics for a particular port.  The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpStatsTable.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortEntry,,not-accessible,lldpStatsRxPortNum,current,,LLDP frame reception statistics for a particular port. The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpStatsTable.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortFramesDiscardedTotal,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of LLDP frames received by this LLDP agent on the indicated port, and then discarded for any reason. This counter can provide an indication that LLDP header formating problems may exist with the local LLDP agent in the sending system or that LLDPDU validation problems may exist with the local LLDP agent in the receiving system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortFramesErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of invalid LLDP frames received by this LLDP agent on the indicated port, while this LLDP agent is enabled.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortTLVsUnrecognizedTotal,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of LLDP TLVs received on the given port that are not recognized by this LLDP agent on the indicated port.  An unrecognized TLV is referred to as the TLV whose type value is in the range of reserved TLV types (000 1001 - 111 1110) in Table 9.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AB-2005. An unrecognized TLV may be a basic management TLV from a later LLDP version.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The counter that represents the number of age-outs that occurred on a given port. An age-out is the number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because the information timeliness interval has expired. This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except that the counter is on a per port basis. This enables NMS to poll tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems on the indicated port only. This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage. When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to 'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with the same port should reset to 0. The agent should also flush all remote system information associated with the same port. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from all related tables on a particular port. Partial aging is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.4.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one or more rows per physical network connection known to this agent. The agent may wish to ensure that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for the same local port. The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote systems information updates from an LLDP agent: 1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved. NMS polls periodically the values of the following objects: a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports. 2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and sends out notifications to a list of notification destinations. 3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new values of objects listed in step 1.  Periodically, NMS should poll the object lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything has changed since the last poll. if something has changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed, then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter with the last-polled time value. This request will return new objects or objects whose values are updated since the last poll. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed, then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and compare the new values with previously recorded ones. For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to retrieve objects associated with those ports from table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.) lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes and lldpStatsRemTablesDrops objects are provided for informational purposes.

If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6,IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a MAC address. The interface's media-specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces which do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7,IF-MIB::ifAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3),The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8,IF-MIB::ifOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,up(1):down(2):testing(3):unknown(4):dormant(5):notPresent(6):lowerLayerDown(7),The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.9,IF-MIB::ifLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10,IF-MIB::ifInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

This object is deprecated in favour of ifInMulticastPkts and ifInBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.13,IF-MIB::ifInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14,IF-MIB::ifInErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of inbound packets that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. For character- oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.15,IF-MIB::ifInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of packets received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces that support protocol multiplexing the number of transmission units received via the interface which were discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. For any interface that does not support protocol multiplexing, this counter will always be 0. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16,IF-MIB::ifOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.

Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime. This object is deprecated in favour of ifOutMulticastPkts and ifOutBroadcastPkts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19,IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.20,IF-MIB::ifOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.22,IF-MIB::ifSpecific,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular media being used to realize the interface. It is recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer textual convention defined in RFC 2579. In fact, it is recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType. If no MIB definitions specific to the particular media are available, the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atEntry,,not-accessible,atIfIndex:atNetAddress,deprecated,,Each entry contains one NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalence.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.1,RFC1213-MIB::atIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,The interface on which this entry's equivalence is effective. The interface identified by a particular value of this index is the same interface as identified by the same value of ifIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.7,RFC1213-MIB::ipInUnknownProtos,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of locally-addressed datagrams received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.8,RFC1213-MIB::ipInDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input IP datagrams for which no problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space).

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of seconds which received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.16,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of failures detected by the IP re- assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc). Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.17,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragOKs,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been successfully fragmented at this entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.18,RFC1213-MIB::ipFragFails,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams that have been discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their Don't Fragment flag was set.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcasts addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.

Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.11,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteMask,IpAddress,read-write,,mandatory,,Indicate the mask to be logical-ANDed with the destination address before being compared to the value in the ipRouteDest field. For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.18.6.1.1,DS1-MIB::dsx1LineIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,This object should be made equal to ifIndex. The next paragraph describes its previous usage. Making the object equal to ifIndex allows proper use of the ifStackTable and ds0/ds0bundle MIBs. Previously, this object was the identifier of a DS1 interface on a managed device. If there is an ifEntry that is directly associated with this and only this DS1 interface, it should have the same value as ifIndex. Otherwise, number the dsx1LineIndices with a unique identifier following the rules of choosing a number that is greater than ifNumber and numbering the inside interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside interfaces (e.g., network side) with odd numbers.

Thus, only 7 bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps, are available for data. dsx1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern of normal bits and bipolar violations that are used to replace a sequence of 8 zero bits. ANSI Clear Channels may use dsx1ZBTSI, or Zero Byte Time Slot Interchange. E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3 or dsx1AMI. dsx1AMI refers to a mode wherein no Zero Code Suppression is present and the line encoding does not solve the problem directly. In this application, the higher layer must provide data that meets or exceeds the pulse density requirements, such as inverting HDLC data. dsx1B6ZS refers to the user of a specified pattern of normal bits and bipolar violations that are used to replace a sequence of 6 zero bits. Used for DS2. For more information about line coding see [ANSI-T1.102]

Agents supporting read/write access should return inconsistentValue in response to a requested loopback state that the interface does not support. The values mean: dsx1NoLoop not in the loopback state. A device that is not capable of performing a loopback on the interface shall always return this as its value. dsx1PayloadLoop the received signal at this interface is looped through the device. Typically, the received signal is looped back for retransmission after it has passed through the device's framing function. dsx1LineLoop the received signal at this interface does not go through the device (minimum penetration) but is looped back out. dsx1OtherLoop loopbacks that are not defined here. dsx1InwardLoop the transmitted signal at this interface is looped back and received by the same interface. What is transmitted onto the line is product dependent. dsx1DualLoop both dsx1LineLoop and dsx1InwardLoop will be active simultaneously.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.18.6.1.10,DS1-MIB::dsx1LineStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,This variable indicates the line status of the interface. It contains loopback, failure, received alarm and transmitted alarms information. The dsx1LineStatus is a bitmap represented as a sum; therefore, it can represent multiple failures (alarms) and a LoopbackState simultaneously. dsx1NoAlarm must be set if and only if no other flag is set. If the dsx1loopbackState bit is set, the loopback in effect can be determined from the dsx1loopbackConfig object. The various bit positions are as follows: 1 dsx1NoAlarm No alarm present 2 dsx1RcvFarEndLOF Far end LOF (a.k.a.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.18.13,DS1-MIB::dsx1FracTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table is deprecated in favor of using ifStackTable. The table was mandatory for systems dividing a DS1 into channels containing different data streams that are of local interest. Systems that are indifferent to data content, such as CSUs, need not implement it. The DS1 Fractional table identifies which DS1 channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table from the Internet-standard MIB. For example, consider an application managing a North American ISDN Primary Rate link whose division is a 384-kbit/s H1 _B_ Channel for video, a second H1 for data to a primary routing peer, and 12 64-kbit/s H0 _B_ Channels. Consider that some subset of the H0 channels is used for voice and the remainder are available for dynamic data calls. We count a total of 14 interfaces multiplexed onto the DS1 interface. Six DS1 channels (for the sake of the example, channels 1..6) are used for video, six more (7..11 and 13) are used for data, and the remaining 12 are in channels 12 and 14..24. Let us further imagine that ifIndex 2 is of type DS1 and refers to the DS1 interface and that the interfaces layered onto it are numbered 3..16. We might describe the allocation of channels, in the dsx1FracTable, as follows: dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.13 = 4 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.14 = 6 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.15 = 7 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.16 = 8 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.17 = 9 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.18 = 10 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.19 = 11 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.20 = 12 dsx1FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.21 = 13 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.22 = 14 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.23 = 15 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.12 = 5 dsx1FracIfIndex.2.24 = 16 For North American (DS1) interfaces, there are 24 legal channels, numbered 1 through 24. For G.704 interfaces, there are 31 legal channels, numbered 1 through 31. The channels (1..31) correspond directly to the equivalently numbered time-slots.

The DS3/E3 fractional table identifies which DS3/E3 channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table from the Internet- standard MIB. For example, consider a DS3 device with 4 high speed links carrying router traffic, a feed for voice, a feed for video, and a synchronous channel for a non-routed protocol. We might describe the allocation of channels, in the dsx3FracTable, as follows: dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.15 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.16 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.17 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 4 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.18 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.19 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.20 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.21 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.22 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.23 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.24 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.25 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.12 = 5 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.26 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.13 = 5 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.27 = 6 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.14 = 5 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.28 = 6 For dsx3M23, dsx3 SYNTRAN, dsx3CbitParity, and dsx3ClearChannel there are 28 legal channels, numbered 1 through 28.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet statistics entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsEntry,,not-accessible,etherStatsIndex,current,,A collection of statistics kept for a particular Ethernet interface. As an example, an instance of the etherStatsPkts object might be named etherStatsPkts.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies this etherStats entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::etherStatsBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to the broadcast address. Note that this does not include multicast packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::etherStatsMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that had a length (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherStatsUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherStatsFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of history control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

Each instance of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry will be deleted by the agent if this historyControlEntry is not equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet history entries.

This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4,RMON-MIB::hosts,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of host table control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hostControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up the discovery of hosts on a particular interface and the collection of statistics about these hosts. For example, an instance of the hostControlTableSize object might be named hostControlTableSize.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostControlLastDeleteTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last entry was deleted from the portion of the hostTable associated with this hostControlEntry. If no deletions have occurred, this value shall be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this hostControl entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated entries in the hostTable, hostTimeTable, and the hostTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that defines the relative ordering of the creation time of hosts captured for a particular hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostInPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostInOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), except for those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::hostOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), including those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::hostOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of bad packets transmitted by this address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::hostOutBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to the broadcast address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::hostOutMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to a multicast address since this host was added to the hostTable. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3,RMON-MIB::hostTimeTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of time-ordered host table entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1,RMON-MIB::hostTimeEntry,,not-accessible,hostTimeIndex:hostTimeCreationOrder,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular host that has been discovered on an interface of this device. This collection includes the relative ordering of the creation time of this object. For example, an instance of the hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts.1.687
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostTimeAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTimeCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostTime table among those entries associated with the same hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostTimeIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hostControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hostControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5,RMON-MIB::hostTopN,,,,,,

When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report, which is loaded into the associated hostTopNDuration object. When this object is set to a non-zero value, any associated hostTopNEntries shall be made inaccessible by the monitor. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. During this time, all associated hostTopNEntries shall remain inaccessible. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the hostTopNTable. Thus, the hostTopN table needs to be created only at the end of the collection interval. DEFVAL { 0 }

When the associated hostTopNTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the hostTopNTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this hostTopNControlEntry. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostTopNRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of hosts requested for the top N table. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set hostTopNGrantedSize as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 10 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::hostTopNGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of hosts in the top N table. When the associated hostTopNRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a set to the associated hostTopNRequestedSize object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterEntry,,not-accessible,filterIndex,current,,A set of parameters for a packet filter applied on a particular interface. As an example, an instance of the filterPktData object might be named filterPktData.12
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the filter table. Each such entry defines one filter that is to be applied to every packet received on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::filterChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the channel of which this filter is a part. The filters identified by a particular value of this object are associated with the same channel as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset from the beginning of each packet where a match of packet data will be attempted. This offset is measured from the point in the physical layer packet after the framing bits, if any. For example, in an Ethernet frame, this point is at the beginning of the destination MAC address. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2,RMON-MIB::channelTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of packet channel entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1,RMON-MIB::channelEntry,,not-accessible,channelIndex,current,,A set of parameters for a packet channel applied on a particular interface. As an example, an instance of the channelMatches object might be named channelMatches.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::channelIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the channel table. Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::channelIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the interface on this remote network monitoring device to which the associated filters are applied to allow data into this channel. The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel. DEFVAL { off }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems. DEFVAL { eventReady }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4,RMON2-MIB::filter2Table,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1,RMON2-MIB::filter2Entry,,not-accessible,,current,,Provides a variable-length packet filter feature to the RMON-1 filter table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirDataLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with performs the following operations on every packet: 1) If the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by this object, discard the packet and exit (i.e., discard the packet if it is not of the identified protocol). 2) If the associated filterProtocolDirLocalIndex is non-zero and the packet doesn't match the protocol directory entry identified by that object, discard the packet and exit. 3) If the packet matches, perform the regular filter algorithm as if the beginning of this named protocol is the beginning of the packet, potentially applying the filterOffset value to move further into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::filterProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,When this object is set to a non-zero value, the filter that it is associated with will discard the packet if the packet doesn't match this protocol directory entry. DEFVAL { 0 }

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of buffers control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlEntry,,not-accessible,bufferControlIndex,current,,A set of parameters that control the collection of a stream of packets that have matched filters. As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible. DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1. DEFVAL { -1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.

The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.7.1.2,RMON2-MIB::ringStationControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,deprecated,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStats2Entry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1.1,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStatsDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11,RMON2-MIB::protocolDir,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.10,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this protocol directory entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this protocolDistControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this row. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13,RMON2-MIB::addressMap,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapControlDroppedFrames.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this entry in the addressMapControlTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for this addressMapControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this addressMap control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hlHostControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the hlHostControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is hlHostControlNlDroppedFrames.1

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0.

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.

An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the alMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A set of statistics for those application-layer matrix entries that have counted the highest number of octets or packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNEntry,,not-accessible,alMatrixTopNControlIndex:alMatrixTopNIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the alMatrixTopNTable. The alMatrixTopNControlIndex value in the index identifies the alMatrixTopNControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. An example of the indexing of this table is alMatrixTopNPktRate.3.10
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alMatrixTopNTable among those in the same report. This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The protocolDirLocalIndex of the network-layer protocol of this entry's network address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNSourceAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the source host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNDestAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the destination host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReversePktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSPkts object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDOctets object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReverseOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSOctets object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDOctets object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNOctetRate, and not on the value of this object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a group of user-defined MIB objects to be sampled periodically (called a bucket-group). For example, an instance of usrHistoryControlInterval might be named usrHistoryControlInterval.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlObjects,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of MIB objects to be collected in the portion of usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. This object may not be modified if the associated instance of usrHistoryControlStatus is equal to active(1).

When this object is created or modified, the probe should set usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A list of MIB instances to be sampled periodically. Entries in this table are created when an associated usrHistoryControlObjects object is created. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index is that of the associated usrHistoryControlEntry. For example, an instance of usrHistoryObjectVariable might be usrHistoryObjectVariable.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19,RMON2-MIB::probeConfig,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.1,RMON2-MIB::probeCapabilities,BITS,read-only,,current,etherStats(0):historyControl(1):etherHistory(2):alarm(3):hosts(4):hostTopN(5):matrix(6):filter(7):capture(8):event(9):tokenRingMLStats(10):tokenRingPStats(11):tokenRingMLHistory(12):tokenRingPHistory(13):ringStation(14):ringStationOrder(15):ringStationConfig(16):sourceRouting(17):protocolDirectory(18):protocolDistribution(19):addressMapping(20):nlHost(21):nlMatrix(22):alHost(23):alMatrix(24):usrHistory(25):probeConfig(26),An indication of the RMON MIB groups supported on at least one interface by this probe.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to '0.0.0.0' when no IP address has been specified.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.8,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadAction,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notDownloading(1):downloadToPROM(2):downloadToRAM(3),When this object is set to downloadToRAM(3) or downloadToPROM(2), the device will discontinue its normal operation and begin download of the image specified by probeDownloadFile from the server specified by probeDownloadTFTPServer using the TFTP protocol. If downloadToRAM(3) is specified, the new image is copied to RAM only (the old image remains unaltered in the flash EPROM). If downloadToPROM(2) is specified, the new image is written to the flash EPROM memory after its checksum has been verified to be correct. When the download process is completed, the device will warm boot to restart the newly loaded application. When the device is not downloading, this object will have a value of notDownloading(1). This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.

This object will have a value of downloadStatusUnknown(2) if no download process has been performed. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.10,RMON2-MIB::serialConfigTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,A table of serial interface configuration entries. This data will be stored in non-volatile memory and preserved across probe resets or power loss.

If either the netConfigIPAddress or netConfigSubnetMask is 0.0.0.0, then when the device boots, it may use BOOTP to try to figure out what these values should be. If BOOTP fails before the device can talk on the network, this value must be configured (e.g., through a terminal attached to the device). If BOOTP is used, care should be taken to not send BOOTP broadcasts too frequently and to eventually send them very infrequently if no replies are received.

This table is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least-significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The destination MAC address in a frame to which this entry's filtering information applies. This object can take the value of a unicast address, a group address, or the broadcast address.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2). SNMP engines on bridges supporting a large number of ports must support appropriate maximum message sizes.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.17,IF-MIB::ifConnectorPresent,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has the value 'true(1)' if the interface sublayer has a physical connector and the value 'false(2)' otherwise.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.

To create a VPL at an ATM interface, either of the following procedures are used: Negotiated VPL establishment (1) The management application creates a VPL entry in the atmVplTable by setting atmVplRowStatus to createAndWait(5). This may fail for the following reasons: - The selected VPI value is unavailable, - The selected VPI value is in use. Otherwise, the agent creates a row and reserves the VPI value on that port. (2) The manager selects an existing row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable, thereby, selecting a set of self-consistent ATM traffic parameters and the service category for receive and transmit directions of the VPL. (2a) If no suitable row(s) in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable exists, the manager must create a new row(s) in that table. (2b) The manager characterizes the VPL's traffic parameters through setting the atmVplReceiveTrafficDescrIndex and the atmVplTransmitTrafficDescrIndex values in the VPL table, which point to the rows containing desired ATM traffic parameter values in the atmTrafficDescrParamTable. The agent will check the availability of resources and may refuse the request. If the transmit and receive service categories are inconsistent, the agent should refuse the request. (3) The manager activates the VPL by setting the the atmVplRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources to satisfy the requested traffic parameter values and the service category for that VPL. (4) If the VPL terminates a VPC in the ATM host or switch, the manager turns on the atmVplAdminStatus to up(1) to turn the VPL traffic flow on. Otherwise, the atmVpCrossConnectTable must be used to cross-connect the VPL to another VPL(s) in an ATM switch or network. One-Shot VPL Establishment A VPL may also be established in one step by a set-request with all necessary VPL parameter values and atmVplRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). In contrast to the negotiated VPL establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one-shot VPL establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step-wise error checking. VPL Retirement A VPL is released by setting atmVplRowStatus to destroy(6), and the agent may release all associated resources.

This entry is used to model a bi-directional ATM VP cross-connect which cross-connects two VPLs. Step-wise Procedures to set up a VP Cross-connect Once the entries in the atmVplTable are created, the following procedures are used to cross-connect the VPLs together. (1) The manager obtains a unique atmVpCrossConnectIndex by reading the atmVpCrossConnectIndexNext object. (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the ATM VP Cross Connect Table, one for each cross-connection between two VPLs. Each row is indexed by the ATM interface port numbers and VPI values of the two ends of that cross-connection. This set of rows specifies the topology of the VPC cross-connect and is identified by a single value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex. Negotiated VP Cross-Connect Establishment (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to createAndWait(5). The agent checks the requested topology and the mutual sanity of the ATM traffic parameters and service categories, i.e., the row creation fails if: - the requested topology is incompatible with associated values of atmVplCastType, - the requested topology is not supported by the agent, - the traffic/service category parameter values associated with the requested row are incompatible with those of already existing rows for this VP cross-connect. [For example, for setting up a point-to-point VP cross-connect, the ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction of a VPL at the low end of the cross-connect must equal to the traffic parameters in the transmit direction of the other VPL at the high end of the cross-connect, otherwise, the row creation fails.] The agent also checks for internal errors in building the cross-connect. The atmVpCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVplTable rows are filled in by the agent at this point. (2b) The manager promotes the row in the atmVpCrossConnectTable by setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources specified by the ATM traffic parameter and Service category values for each direction of the VP cross-connect in an ATM switch or network. (3) The manager sets the atmVpCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all rows of this VP cross-connect to turn the traffic flow on. One-Shot VP Cross-Connect Establishment A VP cross-connect may also be established in one step by a set-request with all necessary parameter values and atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). In contrast to the negotiated VP cross-connect establishment which allows for detailed error checking (i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one-shot VP cross-connect establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step-wise error checking. VP Cross-Connect Retirement A VP cross-connect identified by a particular value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex is released by: (1) Setting atmVpCrossConnectRowStatus of all rows identified by this value of atmVpCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6).

This entry is used to model a bi-directional ATM VC cross-connect cross-connecting two end points. Step-wise Procedures to set up a VC Cross-connect Once the entries in the atmVclTable are created, the following procedures are used to cross-connect the VCLs together to form a VCC segment. (1) The manager obtains a unique atmVcCrossConnectIndex by reading the atmVcCrossConnectIndexNext object. (2) Next, the manager creates a set of one or more rows in the ATM VC Cross Connect Table, one for each cross-connection between two VCLs. Each row is indexed by the ATM interface port numbers and VPI/VCI values of the two ends of that cross-connection. This set of rows specifies the topology of the VCC cross-connect and is identified by a single value of atmVcCrossConnectIndex. Negotiated VC Cross-Connect Establishment (2a) The manager creates a row in this table by setting atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus to createAndWait(5). The agent checks the requested topology and the mutual sanity of the ATM traffic parameters and service categories, i.e., the row creation fails if: - the requested topology is incompatible with associated values of atmVclCastType, - the requested topology is not supported by the agent, - the traffic/service category parameter values associated with the requested row are incompatible with those of already existing rows for this VC cross-connect. [For example, for setting up a point-to-point VC cross-connect, the ATM traffic parameters in the receive direction of a VCL at the low end of the cross-connect must equal to the traffic parameters in the transmit direction of the other VCL at the high end of the cross-connect, otherwise, the row creation fails.] The agent also checks for internal errors in building the cross-connect. The atmVcCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVclTable rows are filled in by the agent at this point. (2b) The manager promotes the row in the atmVcCrossConnectTable by setting atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus to active(1). If this set is successful, the agent has reserved the resources specified by the ATM traffic parameter and Service category values for each direction of the VC cross-connect in an ATM switch or network. (3) The manager sets the atmVcCrossConnectAdminStatus to up(1) in all rows of this VC cross-connect to turn the traffic flow on. One-Shot VC Cross-Connect Establishment A VC cross-connect may also be established in one step by a set-request with all necessary parameter values and atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus set to createAndGo(4). In contrast to the negotiated VC cross-connect establishment which allows for detailed error checking i.e., set errors are explicitly linked to particular resource acquisition failures), the one-shot VC cross-connect establishment performs the setup on one operation but does not have the advantage of step-wise error checking. VC Cross-Connect Retirement A VC cross-connect identified by a particular value of atmVcCrossConnectIndex is released by: (1) Setting atmVcCrossConnectRowStatus of all rows identified by this value of atmVcCrossConnectIndex to destroy(6). The agent may release all associated resources, and the atmVcCrossConnectIndex values in the corresponding atmVclTable row are removed. Note that a situation when only a subset of

The scheduler must ignore all periodic schedules that have a schedInterval value of 0. A periodic schedule with a scheduling interval of 0 seconds will therefore never invoke an action. Implementations may be forced to delay invocations in the face of local constraints. A scheduled management function should therefore not rely on the accuracy provided by the scheduler implementation.

There are two sets of bits one can use to define the day within a month: Enumerations starting with the letter 'd' indicate a day in a month relative to the first day of a month. The first day of the month can therefore be specified by setting the bit d1(0) and d31(30) means the last day of a month with 31 days. Enumerations starting with the letter 'r' indicate a day in a month in reverse order, relative to the last day of a month. The last day in the month can therefore be specified by setting the bit r1(31) and r31(61) means the first day of a month with 31 days. Setting multiple bits will include several days in the set of possible days for this schedule. Setting all bits will cause the scheduler to ignore the day within a month.

Note that an implementation may choose to issue an SNMP Set message to the SNMP engine and leave the access control decision to the normal message processing procedure. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.13,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,periodic(1):calendar(2):oneshot(3),The type of this schedule. The value periodic(1) indicates that this entry specifies a periodic schedule. A periodic schedule is defined by the value of schedInterval. The values of schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour and schedMinute are ignored. The value calendar(2) indicates that this entry describes a calendar schedule. A calendar schedule is defined by the values of schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour and schedMinute. The value of schedInterval is ignored. A calendar schedule will trigger on all local times that satisfy the bits set in schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour and schedMinute. The value oneshot(3) indicates that this entry describes a one-shot schedule. A one-shot schedule is similar to a calendar schedule with the additional feature that it disables itself by changing in the `finished' schedOperStatus once the schedule triggers an action. Note that implementations which maintain a list of pending activations must re-calculate them when this object is changed. DEFVAL { periodic }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.14,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),The desired state of the schedule. DEFVAL { disabled }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.15,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2):finished(3),The current operational state of this schedule. The state enabled(1) indicates this entry is active and that the scheduler will invoke actions at appropriate times. The disabled(2) state indicates that this entry is currently inactive and ignored by the scheduler. The finished(3) state indicates that the schedule has ended. Schedules in the finished(3) state are ignored by the scheduler. A one-shot schedule enters the finished(3) state when it deactivates itself. Note that the operational state must not be enabled(1) when the schedRowStatus is not active.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.16,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedFailures,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This variable counts the number of failures while invoking the scheduled action. This counter at most increments once for a triggered action.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.17,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedLastFailure,INTEGER,read-only,,current,noResponse(-1):noError(0):tooBig(1):noSuchName(2):badValue(3):readOnly(4):genErr(5):noAccess(6):wrongType(7):wrongLength(8):wrongEncoding(9):wrongValue(10):noCreation(11):inconsistentValue(12):resourceUnavailable(13):commitFailed(14):undoFailed(15):authorizationError(16):notWritable(17):inconsistentName(18),The most recent error that occurred during the invocation of a scheduled action. The value noError(0) is returned if no errors have occurred yet. DEFVAL { noError }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.18,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedLastFailed,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The date and time when the most recent failure occurred. The value '0000000000000000'H is returned if no failure occurred since the last re-initialization of the scheduler. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.19,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),This object defines whether this scheduled action is kept in volatile storage and lost upon reboot or if this row is backed up by non-volatile or permanent storage. Conceptual rows having the value `permanent' must allow write access to the columnar objects schedDescr, schedInterval, schedContextName, schedVariable, schedValue, and schedAdminStatus. If an implementation supports the schedCalendarGroup, write access must be also allowed to the columnar objects schedWeekDay, schedMonth, schedDay, schedHour, schedMinute. DEFVAL { volatile }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.20,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this scheduled action. A control that allows entries to be added and removed from this table. Note that the operational state must change to enabled when the administrative state is enabled and the row status changes to active(1). Attempts to destroy(6) a row or to set a row notInService(2) while the operational state is enabled result in inconsistentValue errors. The value of this object has no effect on whether other objects in this conceptual row can be modified.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.63.1.2.1.21,DISMAN-SCHEDULE-MIB::schedTriggers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This variable counts the number of attempts (either successful or failed) to invoke the scheduled action.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.158,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamMIB,,,,,,The MIB module for managing the new Ethernet OAM features introduced by the Ethernet in the First Mile taskforce (IEEE 802.3ah). The functionality presented here is based on IEEE 802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004. [802.3ah] was prepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3 [802.3-2002]. Since then, [802.3ah] has been merged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005]. In particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions introduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. The OAM functionality of Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes introduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah]. The OAM functions are not specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and can be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of [802.3-2002]. An Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame with a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC address for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a lengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow Protocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the subtype reserved for Ethernet OAM. OAMPDU is used throughout this document as an abbreviation for Ethernet OAM protocol data unit. The following reference is used throughout this MIB module: [802.3ah] refers to: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004: 'Draft amendment to - Information technology - Telecommunications and information exchange between systems - Local and metropolitan area networks - Specific requirements - Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical layer specifications - Media Access Control Parameters, Physical Layers and Management Parameters for subscriber access networks', October 2004.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.0,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamNotifications,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.0.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamThresholdEvent,,,,,,A dot3OamThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or remote threshold crossing event is detected. A local threshold crossing event is detected by the local entity, while a remote threshold crossing event is detected by the reception of an Ethernet OAM Event Notification OAMPDU that indicates a threshold event. This notification should not be sent more than once per second. The OAM entity can be derived from extracting the ifIndex from the variable bindings. The objects in the notification correspond to the values in a row instance in the dot3OamEventLogTable. The management entity should periodically check dot3OamEventLogTable to detect any missed events.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.0.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamNonThresholdEvent,,,,,,A dot3OamNonThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or remote non-threshold crossing event is detected. A local event is detected by the local entity, while a remote event is detected by the reception of an Ethernet OAM Event Notification OAMPDU that indicates a non-threshold crossing event. This notification should not be sent more than once per second. The OAM entity can be derived from extracting the ifIndex from the variable bindings. The objects in the notification correspond to the values in a row instance of the dot3OamEventLogTable. The management entity should periodically check dot3OamEventLogTable to detect any missed events.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains the primary controls and status for the OAM capabilities of an Ethernet-like interface. There will be one row in this table for each Ethernet-like interface in the system that supports the OAM functions defined in [802.3ah]. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table that contains information on the Ethernet OAM function for a single Ethernet like interface. Entries in the table are created automatically for each interface supporting Ethernet OAM. The status of the row entry can be determined from dot3OamOperStatus. A dot3OamEntry is indexed in the dot3OamTable by the ifIndex object of the Interfaces MIB. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamAdminState,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),This object is used to provision the default administrative OAM mode for this interface. This object represents the desired state of OAM for this interface. The dot3OamAdminState always starts in the disabled(2) state until an explicit management action or configuration information retained by the system causes a transition to the enabled(1) state. When enabled(1), Ethernet OAM will attempt to operate over this interface. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamOperStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,disabled(1):linkFault(2):passiveWait(3):activeSendLocal(4):sendLocalAndRemote(5):sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6):oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7):oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8):operational(9):nonOperHalfDuplex(10),At initialization and failure conditions, two OAM entities on the same full-duplex Ethernet link begin a discovery phase to determine what OAM capabilities may be used on that link. The progress of this initialization is controlled by the OA sublayer. This value is always disabled(1) if OAM is disabled on this interface via the dot3OamAdminState. If the link has detected a fault and is transmitting OAMPDUs with a link fault indication, the value is linkFault(2). Also, if the interface is not operational (ifOperStatus is not up(1)), linkFault(2) is returned. Note that the object ifOperStatus may not be up(1) as a result of link failure or administrative action (ifAdminState being down(2) or testing(3)). The passiveWait(3) state is returned only by OAM entities in passive mode (dot3OamMode) and reflects the state in which the OAM entity is waiting to see if the peer device is OA capable. The activeSendLocal(4) value is used by active mode devices (dot3OamMode) and reflects the OAM entity actively trying to discover whether the peer has OAM capability but has not yet made that determination. The state sendLocalAndRemote(5) reflects that the local OA entity has discovered the peer but has not yet accepted or rejected the configuration of the peer. The local device can, for whatever reason, decide that the peer device is unacceptable and decline OAM peering. If the local OAM entity rejects the peer OAM entity, the state becomes oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7). If the OAM peering is allowed by the local device, the state moves to sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemote(5) and oamPeeringLocallyRejected(7) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the local OAM client has actively rejected the peering or has just not indicated any decision yet. Whether a peering decision has been made is indicated via the local flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.10). If the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state becomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8). Note that both the sendLocalAndRemoteOk(6) and oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8) states fall within the state SEND_LOCAL_REMOTE_OK of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5], with the difference being whether the remote OAM client has rejected the peering or has just not yet decided. This is indicated via the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11). When the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote OAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to operational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the Discovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5]. Since Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work completely over half-duplex interfaces, the value nonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is enabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface is in half-duplex operation. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.3,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,passive(1):active(2),This object configures the mode of OAM operation for this Ethernet-like interface. OAM on Ethernet interfaces may be in 'active' mode or 'passive' mode. These two modes differ in that active mode provides additional capabilities to initiate monitoring activities with the remote OAM peer entity, while passive mode generally waits for the peer to initiate OA actions with it. As an example, an active OAM entity can put the remote OAM entity in a loopback state, where a passive OA entity cannot. The default value of dot3OamMode is dependent on the type of system on which this Ethernet-like interface resides. The default value should be 'active(2)' unless it is known that this system should take on a subservient role to the other device connected over this interface. Changing this value results in incrementing the configuration revision field of locally generated OAMPDUs (30.3.6.1.12) and potentially re-doing the OAM discovery process if the dot3OamOperStatus was already operational(9). 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.4,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamMaxOamPduSize,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The largest OAMPDU that the OAM entity supports. OA entities exchange maximum OAMPDU sizes and negotiate to use the smaller of the two maximum OAMPDU sizes between the peers. This value is determined by the local implementation. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.5,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamConfigRevision,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The configuration revision of the OAM entity as reflected in the latest OAMPDU sent by the OAM entity. The config revision is used by OAM entities to indicate that configuration changes have occurred, which might require the peer OAM entity to re-evaluate whether OAM peering is allowed. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.1.1.6,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamFunctionsSupported,BITS,read-only,,current,unidirectionalSupport(0):loopbackSupport(1):eventSupport(2):variableSupport(3),The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet-like interface. OAM consists of separate functional sets beyond the basic discovery process that is always required. These functional groups can be supported independently by any implementation. These values are communicated to the peer via the local configuration field of Information OAMPDUs. Setting 'unidirectionalSupport(0)' indicates that the OA entity supports the transmission of OAMPDUs on links that are operating in unidirectional mode (traffic flowing in one direction only). Setting 'loopbackSupport(1)' indicates that the OAM entity can initiate and respond to loopback commands. Setting 'eventSupport(2)' indicates that the OAM entity can send and receive Event Notification OAMPDUs. Setting 'variableSupport(3)' indicates that the OAM entity can send and receive Variable Request and Response OAMPDUs. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains information about the OAM peer for a particular Ethernet-like interface. OAM entities communicate with a single OAM peer entity on Ethernet links on which OA is enabled and operating properly. There is one entry in this table for each entry in the dot3OamTable for which information on the peer OAM entity is available. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table containing information on the peer OA entity for a single Ethernet-like interface. Note that there is at most one OAM peer for each Ethernet-like interface. Entries are automatically created when information about the OAM peer entity becomes available, and automatically deleted when the OAM peer entity is no longer in communication. Peer information is not available when dot3OamOperStatus is disabled(1), linkFault(2), passiveWait(3), activeSendLocal(4), or nonOperHalfDuplex(10). 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerMacAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The MAC address of the peer OAM entity. The MAC address is derived from the most recently received OAMPDU. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerVendorOui,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The OUI of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. The OUI can be used to identify the vendor of the remote OA entity. This value is initialized to three octets of zero before any Local Information TLV is received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.3,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerVendorInfo,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The Vendor Info of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. The semantics of the Vendor Information field is proprietary and specific to the vendor (identified by the dot3OamPeerVendorOui). This information could, for example, be used to identify a specific product or product family. This value is initialized to zero before any Local Information TLV is received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.4,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerMode,INTEGER,read-only,,current,passive(1):active(2):unknown(3),The mode of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. The mode of the peer can be determined from the Configuration field in the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer. The value is unknown(3) whenever no Local Information TLV has been received. The values of active(2) and passive(1) are returned when a Local Information TLV has been received indicating that the peer is in active or passive mode, respectively. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.5,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerMaxOamPduSize,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The maximum size of OAMPDU supported by the peer as reflected in the latest Information OAMPDU received with a Local Information TLV. Ethernet OAM on this interface must not use OAMPDUs that exceed this size. The maximum OAMPDU size can be determined from the PDU Configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the last Information OAMPDU received from the peer. A value of zero is returned if no Local Information TLV has been received. Otherwise, the value of the OAM peer's maximum OAMPDU size is returned in this value. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.6,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerConfigRevision,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,The configuration revision of the OAM peer as reflected in the latest OAMPDU. This attribute is changed by the peer whenever it has a local configuration change for Ethernet OA on this interface. The configuration revision can be determined from the Revision field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. A value of zero is returned if no Local Information TLV has been received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.2.1.7,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamPeerFunctionsSupported,BITS,read-only,,current,unidirectionalSupport(0):loopbackSupport(1):eventSupport(2):variableSupport(3),The OAM functions supported on this Ethernet-like interface. OAM consists of separate functionality sets above the basic discovery process. This value indicates the capabilities of the peer OAM entity with respect to these functions. This value is initialized so all bits are clear. If unidirectionalSupport(0) is set, then the peer OAM entity supports sending OAM frames on Ethernet interfaces when the receive path is known to be inoperable. If loopbackSupport(1) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send and receive OAM loopback commands. If eventSupport(2) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send and receive event OAMPDUs to signal various error conditions. If variableSupport(3) is set, then the peer OAM entity can send and receive variable requests to monitor the attribute value as described in Clause 57 of [802.3ah]. The capabilities of the OAM peer can be determined from the configuration field of the Local Information TLV of the most recently received Information OAMPDU with a Local Information TLV. All zeros are returned if no Local Information TLV has yet been received. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains controls for the loopback state of the local link as well as indicates the status of the loopback function. There is one entry in this table for each entry in dot3OamTable that supports loopback functionality (where dot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the loopbackSupport bit set). Loopback can be used to place the remote OAM entity in a state where every received frame (except OAMPDUs) is echoed back over the same interface on which they were received. In this state, at the remote entity, 'normal' traffic is disabled as only the looped back frames are transmitted on the interface. Loopback is thus an intrusive operation that prohibits normal data flow and should be used accordingly. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex,current,,An entry in the table, containing information on the loopback status for a single Ethernet-like interface. Entries in the table are automatically created whenever the local OAM entity supports loopback capabilities. The loopback status on the interface can be determined from the dot3OamLoopbackStatus object. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3.1.1,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,noLoopback(1):initiatingLoopback(2):remoteLoopback(3):terminatingLoopback(4):localLoopback(5):unknown(6),The loopback status of the OAM entity. This status is determined by a combination of the local parser and multiplexer states, the remote parser and multiplexer states, as well as by the actions of the local OAM client. When operating in normal mode with no loopback in progress, the status reads noLoopback(1). The values initiatingLoopback(2) and terminatingLoopback(4) can be read or written. The other values can only be read - they can never be written. Writing initiatingLoopback causes the local OAM entity to start the loopback process with its peer. This value can only be written when the status is noLoopback(1). Writing the value initiatingLoopback(2) in any other state has no effect. When in remoteLoopback(3), writing terminatingLoopback(4) causes the local OAM entity to initiate the termination of the loopback state. Writing terminatingLoopack(4) in any other state has no effect. If the OAM client initiates a loopback and has sent a Loopback OAMPDU and is waiting for a response, where the local parser and multiplexer states are DISCARD (see [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1]), the status is 'initiatingLoopback'. In this case, the local OAM entity has yet to receive any acknowledgment that the remote OAM entity has received its loopback command request. If the local OAM client knows that the remote OAM entity is in loopback mode (via the remote state information as described in [802.3ah, 57.2.11.1, 30.3.6.1.15]), the status is remoteLoopback(3). If the local OAM client is in the process of terminating the remote loopback [802.3ah, 57.2.11.3, 30.3.6.1.14] with its local multiplexer and parser states in DISCARD, the status is terminatingLoopback(4). If the remote OAM client has put the local OAM entity in loopback mode as indicated by its local parser state, the status is localLoopback(5). The unknown(6) status indicates that the parser and multiplexer combination is unexpected. This status may be returned if the OAM loopback is in a transition state but should not persist. The values of this attribute correspond to the following values of the local and remote parser and multiplexer states. value LclPrsr LclMux RmtPrsr RmtMux noLoopback FWD FWD FWD FWD initLoopback DISCARD DISCARD FWD FWD rmtLoopback DISCARD FWD LPBK DISCARD tmtngLoopback DISCARD DISCARD LPBK DISCARD lclLoopback LPBK DISCARD DISCARD FWD unknown *** any other combination *** 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.3.1.2,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamLoopbackIgnoreRx,INTEGER,read-write,,current,ignore(1):process(2),Since OAM loopback is a disruptive operation (user traffic does not pass), this attribute provides a mechanism to provide controls over whether received OAM loopback commands are processed or ignored. When the value is ignore(1), received loopback commands are ignored. When the value is process(2), OAM loopback commands are processed. The default value is to ignore loopback commands (ignore(1)). 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.158.1.4,DOT3-OAM-MIB::dot3OamStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains statistics for the OAM function on a particular Ethernet-like interface. There is an entry in the table for every entry in the dot3OamTable. The counters in this table are defined as 32-bit entries to match the counter size as defined in [802.3ah].

This table contains the mechanisms to enable Event Notifications and configure the thresholds to generate the standard Ethernet OAM events. There is one entry in the table for every entry in dot3OamTable that supports OAM events (where dot3OamFunctionsSupported includes the eventSupport bit set). The values in the table are maintained across changes to dot3OamOperStatus. The standard threshold crossing events are: - Errored Symbol Period Event. Generated when the number of symbol errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a number of symbols (for example, 1,000 symbols out of 1,000,000 had errors). - Errored Frame Period Event. Generated when the number of frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a number of frames (for example, 10 frames out of 1000 had errors). - Errored Frame Event. Generated when the number of frame errors exceeds a threshold within a given window defined by a period of time (for example, 10 frames in 1 second had errors). - Errored Frame Seconds Summary Event. Generated when the number of errored frame seconds exceeds a threshold within a given time period (for example, 10 errored frame seconds within the last 100 seconds). An errored frame second is defined as a 1 second interval which had >0 frame errors. There are other events (dying gasp, critical events) that are not threshold crossing events but which can be enabled/disabled via this table.

.1.3.111.2.802.1.1.8.0.1,IEEE8021-CFM-MIB::dot1agCfmFaultAlarm,,,,,,A MEP has a persistent defect condition. A notification (fault alarm) is sent to the management entity with the OID of the MEP that has detected the fault. Whenever a MEP has a persistent defect, it may or may not generate a Fault Alarm to warn the system administrator of the problem, as controlled by the MEP Fault Notification Generator State Machine and associated Managed Objects. Only the highest-priority defect, as shown in Table 20-1, is reported in the Fault Alarm. If a defect with a higher priority is raised after a Fault Alarm has been issued, another Fault Alarm is issued. The management entity receiving the notification can identify the system from the network source address of the notification, and can identify the MEP reporting the defect by the indices in the OID of the dot1agCfmMepHighestPrDefect variable in the notification: dot1agCfmMdIndex - Also the index of the MEP's Maintenance Domain table entry (dot1agCfmMdTable). dot1agCfmMaIndex - Also an index (with the MD table index) of the MEP's Maintenance Association network table entry (dot1agCfmMaNetTable), and (with the MD table index and component ID) of the MEP's MA component table entry (dot1agCfmMaCompTable). dot1agCfmMepIdentifier - MEP Identifier and final index into the MEP table (dot1agCfmMepTable).

An MA is a set of MEPs, each configured with a single service instance. This is the part of the complete MA table that is constant across all Bridges in a Maintenance Domain, and across all components of a single Bridge. That part of the MA table that can vary from Bridge component to Bridge component is contained in the dot1agCfmMaCompTable. Creation of a Service Instance establishes a connectionless association among the selected DSAPs. Configuring a Maintenance association Endpoint (MEP) at each of the DSAPs creates a Maintenance Association (MA) to monitor that connectionless connectivity. The MA is identified by a Short MA Name that is unique within the Maintenance Domain and chosen to facilitate easy identification of the Service Instance. Together, the Maintenance Domain Name and the Short MA Name form the Maintenance Association Identifier (MAID) that is carried in CFM Messages to identify incorrect connectivity among Service Instances. A small integer, the Maintenance association Endpoint Identifier (MEPID), identifies each MEP among those configured on a single MA (3.132, 18.2). This table uses two indices, first index is the index of the Maintenance Domain table. The second index is the same as the index of the dot1agCfmMaCompEntry for the same MA.

For all Bridges in which the same MAID {dot1agCfmMdFormat, dot1agCfmMdName, dot1agCfmMaNetFormat, and dot1agCfmMaNetName} is configured, the same set of dot1agCfmMaMepListIdentifiers MUST be configured in the Bridges' dot1agCfmMaMepListTables. This allows each MEP to determine whether or not it is receiving CCMs from all of the other MEPs in the MA. For example, if one were creating a new MA whose MAID were {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'}, that had 2 MEPs, whose MEPIDs were 1 and 3, one could, in Bridge A: 1. Get a new MD index d from dot1agCfmMdTableNextIndex. 2. Create the Maintenance Domain {charString, 'Dom1'}. 3. Get a new MA index a from dot1agCfmMdMaNextIndex [d]. 4. Create the Maintenance Association {charString, 'MA1'}. 5. Create a new dot1agCfmMaMepListEntry for each of the MEPs in the MA: [d, a, 1] and [d, a, 3]. 6. Create one of the new MEPs, say [d, a, 1]. Then, in Bridge B: 7. Do all of these steps 1-6, except for using the other MEPID for the new MEP in Step 6, in this example, MEPID 3. Note that, when creating the MA, MEP List Table, and MEP entries in the second Bridge, the indices 'd' and 'a' identifying the MAID {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'} may have different values than those in the first Bridge.

.1.3.111.2.802.1.1.8.1.7.1,IEEE8021-CFM-MIB::dot1agCfmMepTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The Maintenance Association Endpoint (MEP) table. Each row in the table represents a different MEP. A MEP is an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive CFM PDUs and track any responses. It is an endpoint of a single Maintenance Association, and is an endpoint of a separate Maintenance Entity for each of the other MEPs in the same Maintenance Association (3.132). This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain and MA tables, the reason being that a MEP is always related to an MA and Maintenance Domain. The MEP table also stores all the managed objects for sending LBM and LTM. *LBM Managed objects LBM Managed objects in the MEP table enables the management entity to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. It will signal the MEP that it SHOULD transmit some number of Loopback messages and detect the detection (or lack thereof) of the corresponding Loopback messages. Steps to use entries in this table: 1) Wait for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value to be false. To do this do this sequence: a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU). b. Check if value for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus is false. - if not, wait x seconds, go to step a above. - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go to step 2) below 2) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from false to true to ensure no other management entity will use the service. In order to not disturb a possible other NMS do this by sending an SNMP SET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU, and make sure SNmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind). For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you obtained in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating NMSes will not step on each others toes. Setting this MIB object does not set the corresponding LBIactive state machine variable. 3) Setup the different data to be sent (number of messages, optional TLVs,...), except do not set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages. 4) Record the current values of dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu. 6) Set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages to a non-zero value to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. The dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages indicates the number of LBMs to be sent and is not decremented as loopbacks are actually sent. dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages is not equivalent to the LBMsToSend state machine variable. 7) Check the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmResultOK to find out if the operation was successfully initiated or not. 8) Monitor the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus. When it is reset to false, the last LBM has been transmitted. Wait an additional 5 seconds to ensure that all LBRs have been returned. 9) Compare dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu to their old values from step 4, above, to get the results of the test. *LTM Managed objects The LTM Managed objects in the MEP table are used in a manner similar to that described for LBM transmission, above. A SET operation to the variable dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmFlags triggers the transmission of an LTM. Then, the variables dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmSeqNumber and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmEgressIdentifier return the information required to recover the resu
