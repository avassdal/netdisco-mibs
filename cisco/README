1.  It seems that the general .tar.gz files are horribly out of date. So we
have to get the nightly tarballs from the individual files.
    wget ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v2/v2.tar.gz
    wget ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/v1/v1.tar.gz

2. Move the old dir out of the way
    mv cisco /tmp/cisco_old 

3. Make a new dir and unarchive
    mkdir cisco
    cd cisco
    tar xvfz ../v2.tar.gz
    tar xvfz ../v1.tar.gz

4. Remove Cruft
    rm -f *CAPABILITY.my
    rm -f *V1SMI.my
    rm -f CISCO-GENERAL-TRAPS.my

5. Remove duplicates
    Use cisco_remove as a good starting point
        for f in `cat cisco_remove`; do rm -f $f; done

    cd ..
    mkindex
    ./chk_dups > dups.txt    

    Review that file and make sure the newest file ends up in the right directory.
    Do not put non-cisco mibs in the cisco directory.

    Some cisco RFC's are updated and can be used, check to see which dups are left


All other duplicates in cisco/ are either out of date, modified
or exactly the same and should be removed.

    Remove the dups that don't diff
        ./mkindex
        ./rm_cisco_dups
        ./mkindex
        ./chk_dups

6. Move the original (CVS) directory back and then copy the new versions over.
    mv cisco cisco.new
    mv /tmp/cisco.old cisco
    cp -f cisco.new/* cisco
    rm -f cisco.new

7. Patch
    cd cisco
    patch < ../cisco1.diff
    patch < ../cisco2.diff
    rm -f *.rej *.orig
    cd ..

8. Check
    ./chk_mibs cisco
